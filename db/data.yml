                WORLDWIDE LOSS OF SOIL AND A POSSIBLE SOLUTION


               Reports during the 1970s indicated that large-scale agricultural techniques in the United States
      were depleting the soil about 8 times faster than they were being created naturally. In 1994, the United
      States Department of Agriculture reported that approximately 12,000 pounds of soil were being lost per

      acre per year (13,300 kg of soil were being lost per hectare per year) from wind and water erosion of U.S.
      land farmed with large -scale techniques. A      1 gir          ll,a
      approximately 16,000 pounds of soil per acre per year (17,800 kg of soil per hectare per year) were being

      lost earlier due to wind and water erosion at the time when soil conservation practices were instituted in
      the 1970s. 2
               Since the average person consumes approximately 2,000 pounds (900 kg) of food annually, the

      above data can be developed to show that approximately 8 pounds (3.6 kg) of soil were previously lost
      due to wind and water erosion for each pound of f ood eaten. Currently, approximately 6 pounds (2.7 kg)
      of soil are being lost due to wind and water erosion per pound of food eaten annually.

               In addition, in the late 1970s, the California government issued statistics indicating that in
      California it was taking as much as 2,000 years for nature to build up 1 inch (2.5 cm) of soil, and that
      California large-scale agriculture was depleting as much as 1 inch (2.5 cm) of topsoil every 25 years. As a

      result, California agriculture was depleting the soil as much as 80 times faster than it was being created in
      nature.
               Normally it takes an average of 500 yearsfor nature to build up 1 inch (2.5 cm) of topsoil. To

      grow good crops agriculturally, 6 inches (15 cm) of topsoil are required. Therefore, approximately 3,00          0
      years are needed to build up a reasonable agricultural soil. I n contrast, the 12,000 pounds per acre (13,300
      kg per hectare) of soil being lost in the U.S. on the average annually is 0.0356 inch (approximately 1/28th

      of an inch) of soil over 1 acre (0.90 4 cm of soil over one hectare). Since only 1/500th of an inch (0.00508
      cm) of topsoil is being built up naturally on the average annually in the U.S., soil is being depleted on the
      average each year approximately 18 times faster than it is being built up in nature.    3
                                               4
               In contrast, a Master's thesis at the University of California–Berkeley in 1983 indicated that
      Biointensive practices, over an eight-year period (as performed by Ecology Action on Syntex Corporation
      land at the Stanford University Industrial Park), built up the humified carbon level in the upper 1 to 1.5

      inches (2.5 to 4 cm) of the soil, which began as only 'C' -horizon subsoil, to a level that would have taken
      nature alone 500 years to accomplish. Therefore, this thesis indicated that Biointen sive techniques have
      the potential to build soil up to 60 times faster than it can be developed by nature alone.

               In addition, preliminary indications from research performed by Dr. Ed Glenn at the
      Environmental Research Laboratory at the University of Arziona are that high yields and reduced
      resource consumption may be possible with Biointensive agriculture on a sustainable basis. Additional

      testing will be needed for a final evaluation, but in comparison with other agricultural practices generally
      being used, Biointensive techniques offer hope for the depleted world soil situation.


      1 Exact figure is 11,572 pounds per acre (12,970 kg per hectare), from : Summary Report 1992 National Resources Inventory
      (Soil Conservation Service, U.S. Department of Agrtre, Washington, DC, 1994).

      2 Worldwide soil erosion rates arehighest in Asia,Africa and South America, averaging approximately 13 metric tons (exact
      figure: 26,768 pounds) to 17.5 metric tons (exact figure: 35,637 pounds) per acre per year. From: C. J.Barrow, Land
      Degradation (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1991).
      3 Based on the statisticsgiven in Footnote2,in developing nations, soil appearsto bebeing depleted up to approximately 36
      times faster than it is being built up in nati China, 54 times faster than it is being built up in nature.

      0  2     世纪 70 年代的研究报告就指出由于农业技术在美国的大规模使用，         土壤枯竭的速度是自

        然耕作的八倍。1994 年，美国农业部就指出由于美国农业大规模使用农业技术，造成了严重的风

                                                               1
        蚀、水蚀问题，导致美国每年每英亩平均有 12,000 磅土壤流失（重量是 13,300 公斤）。       据爱华达

        州的土壤保持专家而言，由于风蚀和水蚀的影响，每年每英亩大约有 16,000 土壤过早流失（重量

        为 17,800 公斤），而当时土壤保持措施才刚刚建立。     2

             因每个人平均每年消费大约 2,000 磅（900 公斤）食物，以上的数据可以衍生说明因为风蚀


        和水蚀，大约有 8 磅（3.6 公斤）的土壤流失了。现在风蚀和水蚀影响，大约有 6 磅（2.7 公斤）的

        土壤流失了。

             此外，20 世纪 70 年代末，加利福利亚政府发布多项数据暗示大自然要花将近 2000 年时间

        才养成 1 英寸（2.5 厘米）土壤，而加州大规模使用农业技术，导致每 25 年就有 1 英寸（2.5 厘米

        ）表土流失。最后造成加州的土地，相比于自然状态下，以快 80 倍的速度减少。


             通常而言，大自然要花将近 500 年的时间养成 1 英寸（2.5cm）表土。如要培育出良好的农

        业，则需要 6 英寸（15 厘米）的表土。因此，大约要花 3000 年的时间才能生成适合耕作的土壤。

        然而，美国每年每英亩有 12000 磅（13,300 公斤每公顷）土壤流失，通常是超过 1 英亩（1 公顷有

        0.904 厘米）范围内有 0.0356 英寸（大约是 1 英寸的 28 分之一）的土壤流失。因为 1 英寸表土的第

        五百分之一才能自然形成，在美国，相比大自然塑造土壤速度而言，土壤流失的速度是其 18 倍。                3

                                             4
             然而，1983 年加利福利亚伯克利大学一篇硕士论文 提到了 Biointensive 试验，在这八年期

        间（Syntex 公司在斯坦福大学工业园开展的生态学效应）在土壤上方 1-1.5 英寸处（2.5-4 厘米处）

        建立了腐殖化碳水平，这是 C 底土层，这层水平相当于大自然用 500 年时间生成的土壤。因此，

        这项理论说明   Biointensive 技术有生成土壤，而且速度比大自然天然形成要快 60 倍。


             此外， Ed Glenn 博士在亚利桑那大学的环境研究实验室出得报告指出在可持续的基础上，

        Biointensive 农业技术可以减少资源浪费和提高产量。虽然最终评估确定需要其他的测试，但是相

        比于已经在使用的农业技术而言，Biointensive 技术给全球土壤流失带来了希望。

              A PERDA MUNDIAL DE SOLO E UMA POSSÍVEL SOLUÇÃO


              Relatórios durante os anos de 1970 indicaram que técnicas de agricultura em larga escala nos
      Estados Unidos esgotaram o solo cerca de 8 vezes mais rápido que se tivessem sido feitas naturalmente.
      Em 1994, o Departamento de Agricultura dos Estados Unidos relatou que aproximadamente 13.300 kg
      (12.000 libras por acre por ano) de solo foram perdidos por hectare por ano devido à erosão pelo vento e
                                                                            1
      pela água de terras dos EUA cultivadas com técnicas de larga escala. De acordo com especialistas de
      conservação do solo em Iowa, aproximadamente 17.800 kg (16.000 libras por acre por ano) de solo por
      hectare por ano foram perdidos precocemente devido à erosão pelo vento e pela água na época em que
      práticas de conservação do solo foram instituídas nos anos de 1970.
              Uma vez que uma pessoa consome em média aproximadamente 900 kg (2.000 libras) de

      alimentos anualmente, os dados acima podem ser desenvolvidos para mostrar que aproximadamente 3,6
      kg (8 libras) de solo foram previamente perdidos devido à erosão pelo vento e pela água para cada libra
      de alimento ingerida. Atualmente, aproximadamente 2,7 kg (6 libras) de solo estão sendo perdidos devido
      à erosão pelo vento e pela água por libra de alimento ingerida anualmente.
              Além disso, no final dos anos 1970, o governo da Califórnia divulgou estatísticas
      indicando que na Califórnia seriam necessários até 2.000 anos para a natureza recompor 2,5 cm

      (1 pol.) de solo, e que a agricultura de larga escala da Califórnia está esgotando até 2,5 cm (1
      pol.) de solo superior a cada 25 anos.        Como resultado, a agricultura da Califórnia estava
      esgotando o solo cerca de 80 vezes mais rápido do que o que estava sendo criado na natureza.
              Normalmente, leva cerca de 500 anos em média para a natureza recompor 2,5 cm (1 pol.) de solo
      superior. Para a agricultura são necessários 15 cm (6 pol.) de solo superior. Portanto, aproximadamente

      3.000 anos são necessários para recompor um solo razoavelmente cultivável.   Em contraste, 13.300 kg
      por hectare (12.000 libras por acre) de solo são perdidos nos EUA na média anual de 0,904 cm
      de solo sobre um hectare (0,0356 pol. - aproximadamente 1/28 avos de uma polegada de solo
      sobre 1 acre). Uma vez que somente 0,00508 cm (1/500 avos de uma polegada) de solo superior

      está sendo recomposto naturalmente na média anual nos EUA, o solo está sendo esgotado na
      média a cada ano aproximadamente 18 vezes mais rápido do que está sendo recomposto na
      natureza. 3
                                                     4
              Emcontraste,um     a tese de mestrado da Universidade da Califórnia em Berkeley em 1983
      indicou que práticas de Biointensiva, em um período de oito anos (realizada pela Ecology Action nas
      áreas da Syntex Corporation no Parque Industrial da Universidade de Stanford), recompôs um nível de
      carbono umidificado no solo superior em 2,5 a 4 cm (1 a 1,5 pol.), que começou somente como um
      subsolo de horizonte "C", a um nível que a natureza poderia levar 500 anos para realizar. Portanto, essa
      tese indicou que técnicas de Biointensiva têm o potencial de recompor o solo até 60 vezes mais rápido

      que a natureza poderia realizar.
              Além disso, indicações preliminares da pesquisa realizada pelo Dr. Ed Glenn no Laboratório de
      Pesquisas Ambientais na Universidade do Arizona mostram que altos rendimentos e consumo de recursos
      reduzido podem ser possíveis com a agricultura Biointensiva de forma sustentável. Testes adicionais
      serão necessários para uma avaliação final, mas em comparação com outras práticas agrícolas geralmente
      sendo usadas, as técnicas de Biointensiva oferecem esperança para a situação mundial de solo esgotado.

                                   PÉRDIDA MUNDIAL DEL SUELO Y UNA SOLUCIÓN POSIBLE 


      Informes realizados durante la década de los años 1970 indicaron que las técnicas de agricultura a gran escala aplicadas en 
      los Estados Unidos estaban agotando el suelo alrededor de 8 veces más rápido de lo que la naturaleza los estaba creando. En 
      1994, el Departamento de Agricultura de los Estados Unidos informó que se estaban perdiendo alrededor de 12.000 libras de 

      suelo  por  acre  por  año  (13.300  kg  de  suelo  por  hectárea  por  año)  debido  a  la  erosión  eólica  e  hídrica  de  las  tierras 
                                                               1
      estadounidenses cultivadas con técnicas a gran escala. Según los especialistas en conservación de suelos de Iowa, se estaban 
      perdiendo alrededor de 16.000 libras de suelo por acre por año (17.800 kg de suelo por hectárea por año) por erosión eólica 
                                                                                                                                 2
      e hídrica al momento en que las prácticas de conservación de suelos se implementaban en la década de        los años 1970.  

      Dado que una persona consume aproximadamente 2.000 libras (900 kg) promedio de alimentos por año, la información 

      mencionada anteriormente puede desarrollarse para mostrar que aproximadamente 8 libras (3,6 kg) de suelo se perdieron 
      anteriormente debido a la erosión eólica e hídrica por cada libra de alimento consumido. En la actualidad,    se están perdiendo 

      alrededor de 6 libras (2,7 kg) de suelo por erosión eólica e hídrica por libra de alimentos consumidos anualmente. 

      Por otro lado, a fines de la década de los años 1970, el gobierno de California publicó estadísticas que indican que en 

      California a la naturaleza le llevaría 2000años formar 1 pulgada de suelo (2,5 cm), y que la agricultura a gran escala allí estaba 
      agotando  1  pulgada  (2,5  m)  de  suelo  superficial  cada  25  años.  Consecuentemente,  la  agricultura  en  California  estaba 
      agotando el suelo 80 veces más rápido que lo que demora la naturaleza en crearlo. 


      Normalmente    la naturaleza demora un promedio de 500 años para crear hasta 1 pulgada (2,5 cm) de suelo superficial. Para 
      cultivar alimentos con técnicas de agricultura, se necesitan 6 pulgadas (15 cm) de suelo superficial. Por lo tanto, se necesitan 

      alrededor de 3.000 años para formar un suelo adecuado para la agricultura. Por otro lado, las 12.000 libras por acre (13.300 
      kg  por  hectárea)  promedio  de  suelo  que  se  están  perdiendo  en  los  EE.  UU.  anualmente  son  0,0356  pulgada 

      (aproximadamente la veintiochoava parte de una pulgada). Dado que sólo 1/500 de una pulgada (0,00508 cm) de suelo 
      superficial se forma naturalmente por     año promedio en los EE. UU., el suelo se está agotando en un promedio anual de 

      aproximadamente 18 veces  más rápido de lo que le lleva a naturaleza crearlo.3 

      Por otro lado, una tesis de maestría4 de la Universidad de Berkeley, California de 1983 indicó que las prácticas biointensivas, 

      en un  período de ocho años (según las desarrolló Ecology Action en una parcela de tierra de Syntex Corporation en el parque 
      industrial de la Universidad de Stanford), formó el nivel de carbono humidificado en la parte superior del suelo de 1 a 1,5 

      pulgadas (2,5 a 4 cm), que comenzó sólo como subsuelo de horizonte ‘C’, a un nivel que a la naturaleza le hubiera llevado 500 
      años para lograrlo. Consecuentemente, esta tesis demuestra que las técnicas biointensivas tienen el potencial de formar 

      suelo hasta 60 veces más rápido de lo que le lleva a la naturaleza sola hacerlo. 

      Además, las indicaciones   preliminares de la investigación realizada por Dr. Ed Glenn en el Laboratorio de Investigación del 

      Medioambiente de la Universidad de Arizona señalan que los rendimientos altos y el consumo reducido de recursos puede 
      ser posible con la agricultura biointensiva de manera sustentable. Será necesario hacer más pruebas para llegar a una 

      evaluación final, pero las técnicas biointensivas, en comparación con otras prácticas de agricultura generalmente usadas, dan 
      esperanza para la situación del suelo agotado en el mundo.

        La cifra exacta es 11,572 libras por acre (12.970 kg por hectárea), de: Summary Report 1992 National Resources Inventory (Servicio de
      Conservación de Suelos, Departamento de Agricultura de los EE. UU., Washington, DC, 1994).
      2 Los índices de erosión mundial más altos se encuentran en Asia, África y América del Sur, con un promedio de 13 toneladas métricas (cifra
      exacta: 26.768 libras) a 17,5 toneladas métricas (cifra exacta: 35.637 libras) por acre por año. De: C. J. Barrow, Land Degradation
      (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1991).

        Según las estadísticas dadas en la Nota al pie 2, en los países en desarrollo, el suelo se está agotando hasta aproximadamente 36 veces más
      rápido de lo que le lleva a la naturaleza crearlo; y en China, 54 veces más rápido de lo que le lleva a la naturaleza crearlo.

                                           INTRODUCTION
       C   ommunities, families, and individuals all over the world are searching for ways to provide the necessary food and
       nutrition for sustenance and health. This handbook is a simple and instffiructive look at GROW BIOINTENSIVE®
       (GB) Sustainable Mini-Farming. It is a method of food-growing that helps revitalize our planet by building soil, using

       a smaller area to produce higher yields than conventional methods, and minimizing water, organic fertilizer, and bio-
       logical pesticide use. It attends to the long-term sustainability of farmland, so that food can ffibe produced generation
       after generation. GB may be part of the solution you, your family, and your community are pursuing.

       As you read this handbook and implement GB, please keep in mind these important basic ideas that under-gird and
       support this method:

          1. GB works with the Earth’s natural cycles to create balance and diversity in the growing space and surrounding
            areas.
          2. GB involves observation, recognizing recurring patterns to learn how to improve the health and productivity of
            the growing system.
          3. Local farmers are important resources.

       As a farmer or gardener you are also important to your family, your community, and the world! Everyone relies on
       nourishing food to eat. You produce that food. All of our grandchildren will need healthy land so they can produce
       food, too. We must take care of the earth for future generations. The farmer faces the unique challenge of how to grow
       good food and care for the farmland at the same time.

       Note: this handbook is written for all people who plant and grow food, whether you identify as farmer, gardener, or

       producer. For simplicity and consistency we have chosen to use the terms “farm” and “farmer” throughout, -o ac
       knowledge that all food-growers contribute to the feeding of humanity, no matter the scale of production.

       GROW BIOINTENSIVE Sustainable Mini-Farming consists of eight principles to guide the farmer to simultane -
       ously grow healthy food and care for the land. These principles are inspired by how plants grow in nature and are
       based on using natural processes to create a thriving and sustainable food-production system. A well-executed GB
       farm approaches sustainability as it becomes a closed system with no
       off-farm sourcing of inputs AND nurtures the soil and ecosystem
       to be self-sustaining. In the long run, a GB farm is a farm that will
       be vital and productive for generations, a monumental achievement!


       The eight principles of GROW BIOINTENSIVE are:

                          PRINCIPLE 1: DEEP SOIL PREPARATION 

                                           Goal: Build Soil and Soil Structure


        L  ooking at GB as a three-legged stool, deep soil preparation is one of the legs. Deep soil preparation builds
        soil and soil structure by loosening the soil to a depth of 24 inches (60 cm).

        Ideal soil structure has both pore space for air and water to move freely and soil particles that hold together

        nicely. Air supports plant roots and soil organisms that give life to the soil and enhance nutrient availability
                                   for the plants. Aerated soil holds water better than compacted soil, requiring less
                                   watering. It also facilitates root penetration, supporting healthy plants and mini-
                                   mizing erosion.

                                   To prepare the soil on your farm, determine where              HINT:
                                                                                          Make the work easier by
                                   your growing beds will be and where your paths        allowing the soil to gently
                                   will be. (Paths are necessary because stepping on
                                   the bed compacts the soil, reversing the process of   slide off the digging spade
                                   digging.) Recommended bed dimensions are 4-5           into the open trench, by
                                   feet (1-1.5 m) wide and 20-25 ft (6.5-10 m) long       letting your weight sink
                                   for a total of 100 ft (10 m ). This bed size works      the fork into the lower
                                   well for labor and space efficiency, and for water      trench, and by raking
                                                                                           after every 5 trenches!
                                   retention. Make your paths wide enough for you
                                   to work easily, but not so wide that you sacrifice
                                   growing space unnecessarily.

                                   To double-dig, stand on a digging board positioned
                                   12 in (30 cm) from the end of the bed. Facing the

                  HINT:            end, use a flat digging spade with a D-handle (or
                                   the tools available to you) to remove soil to make
             When digging or       the first trench, 12 in x 12 in x 5 ft (30 cm x 30
           planting, put a strong, cm x 1.5m). Put the soil you dig out of the trench
           wide digging board on   in a bucket, basket, wheelbarrow or pile to save for
            the bed to distribute  later. Some of this soil will go back into the bed to
           your weight and avoid
            compacting the soil.   complete the double-dig, and some can be used for
                                   compost building and to start seeds. (More about
                                   the uses for bed soil later.)

        With a D-handled digging fork (or other locally available tool), gently loosen
        the lower level of the first trench 12 in (30 cm) deep. If you cannot penetrate

        12 in (30 cm), simply loosen as deeply as you can. Each year the soil will improve from a combination of
        double-digging and the growing action of roots, until you are able to achieve a loose, healthy soil structure
        to the full 24 in (60 cm).

                                Next, move your board 12 in (30 cm) back from the first trench to expose more soil
                                to begin the second trench. Using your digging tool again, move the soil from the
                                top 12 in (30 cm) into the first trench. Now you have a new trench. Loosen the soil

                                in the bottom of this second trench, as deeply as you can.

                                Repeat this pattern until you reach the other end of the bed. At the end you will
                                have one last trench to fill. This soil comes from the soil you removed from the first
                                trench. Fill the trench and rake your soil smooth, your bed is ready for compost. You

                                have crafted the first leg of the stool.

                                                     Notes to Refine Deep Soil Preparation:

      Soil of proper moisture level (like a wrung-out cloth) will be the easiest to work with. If the soil is too dry or
      too wet it is more difficult to dig and the soil structure can be damaged in the process. Make your job easier

      and take care of the soil by watering the bed or keeping it dry, as appropriate, in preparation for digging.

        Choose cool and comfortable times of day for digging. Working in the heat of the day exposes the soil
         organic matter to accelerated oxidation and more will be lost. The farmer uses less energy digging in the
         cool of the day, too!


       If the soil is very compacted, it may not be possible to dig 24 in (60 cm). Simply dig as deeply as you can
         and let the plant roots help you. You can plant deep-rooting crops to accelerate this process. Remember
         this is part of building soil structure, over time the full depth will be achievable!

        Another important part of building soil structure is supporting the beneficial interactions between the

         organisms living in the soil, the roots, and the soil itself. The disruption of deep soil preparation is best
         limited to once every growing season, until good soil structure allows you to dig less often.

       If your soil is overly loose due to sand, double-digging is not helpful. Instead you will want to build soil
         structure by adding organic matter in the form of compost and keeping plants growing year-round so roots
         can support soil microbial life.


                  GB Farmer’s Challenge:

         Watch your soil grow and change. Remember
        the goal of deep soil preparation is to build soil

       and soil structure, not to double-dig. Before you
       dig, check the soil down to 24 in (60 cm), if it is
       loose all the way down you might only single-dig
        (gently loosening the top 12 in (30 cm) with a
       digging fork, like you do for the lower trench in
      the double-dig) or even just loosen the top surface

      of the soil 2-4 in (5-10 cm) so it is ready for com-
                      post and planting.
                                                                                                                         2

                                  PRINCIPLE 2: COMPOSTING 

                                    Goal: Maximize compost quality and quantity
                                                        AND

                                            maximize microbial diversity

        C   omposting is the second leg of the three-legged stool. GB composting strives to produce the maximum
        amount of compost from the materials used. It also maximizes microbial biodiversity through a correctly

        built and “cured” compost pile using plant material from your farm, food scraps from your kitchen, and soil
        from the beds.

        Healthy compost is broken down plant material that returns nutrients and carbon to the soil, so the soil
        regains fertility and waste is minimized. Quality compost in the soil provides sustained release of nutrients
        for plant roots and microorganisms. It provides more aeration for roots and microbes. Compost helps buffer

        challenging soil conditions, like high or low pH, or too much clay or sand. The organic matter in compost
        also helps increase water retention, so you need to water less. By using
        compost to support soil fertility you can be more self-sufficient and            HINT:
        rely less on purchased organic fertilizer.                            Make the base of the pile at least

        To make GB compost, start by picking any space available to put      3 ft x 3 ft (1 m x 1 m) so the pile

        materials, collect them over time and/or use what you have on hand:

        1. Mature Material — Did this plant grow to its old age and produce seed? If so, the plant is mature and made up of
           material that is complex and tougher to breakdown. Think of a corn stalk after it has borne fruit. It is structurally
           strong.

                                                          2. Immature Material— Did this plant grow to its old age
                                                          and produce seed? If not, the plant is immature and made
                                                          of material that is less complex and easier to break down.
                                                          Think of alfalfa plants or lettuce leaves that are very flexible.
                                                          It can sometimes be hard to differentiate between mature

                                                          and immature materials, so just do your best.

                                                          3. Soil — this comes from the first trench of soil you re -
                                                          moved during the double dig. Keep a little around after
                                                          double-digging for compost building.

                                                          4. Roughage -— This is plant material that is thick and
                                                          tough and will take many compost piles before it decom -
                                                          poses. Think of branches from trees or stalks of cassava.
                                                          Roughage is used once in each pile, so only a small amount
                                                          is necessary.

                        Now you are ready to build:                          6

      Step 1 Gently loosen the soil where you will build down to 12 in (30

              cm), so the pile can drain.

      Step 2 Apply roughage about 4 in (10 cm) thick so the pile can drain
              and breathe.                                                    5

      Step 3 Apply a layer of mature material, about 2 in (5 cm) thick and
              water until evenly moist.


      Step 4 Apply a layer of immature material, about 2 in (5 cm) thick
              and water until evenly moist.

      Step 5 Apply a layer of soil about ¼ in (½-1 cm) thick and wa      -
              ter. The soil plays an important role, helping to stabilize the

              moisture and temperature levels of the pile and inoculating it  4
              with microorganisms.

      Step 6 Repeat steps 3 through 5 until you have used up your mate -
              rials or the pile is tall enough for you to stop working on it,
              whichever comes first.


      Notice that you are using equal volumes of mature and immature m-  a
      terials. This is an important component in producing healthy com -
      post, as both the structural integrity of the mature material and the   3
      less-structural immature material contribute to the process of decom-
      position and the humus-formation that make compost so valuable.


                            GB Farmer’s Challenge:

           changes. Even on the inside! Learn to know when it is healthy.     2
                 Let it teach you how to make even better compost.


      If your pile was short when materials ran out or it shrinks a lot, you
      may want to keep adding to the pile when you have more material,
      until you decide to call your compost pile finished. Finishing a pile
      within one month is a good guideline. When you are done building,       1
      an additional layer of soil on the top will help the pile to hold mois -
      ture. Your compost pile will begin to shrink after you build it.

                                              To maintain your compost pile:


        Because compost is the result of decomposition, maintaining a compost pile is
        about creating the ideal conditions for this process. Decomposition is carried                 HINT:
        out by microorganisms in the presence of moisture and air; therefore, the pile           Use many different
        must have enough moisture (like a wrung-out cloth) and enough air (too much            kinds of plant material
        moisture limits air). You have four strategies to create the moisture balance you       to support a variety of
                                                                                                microorganisms. This
        want: a) You can loosen your pile, b) water your pile, c)cover your pile or d) do       maximizes microbial

        you may choose to turn the pile. The best time to do this is after the teffimpera-

        ture of the pile has peaked and dropped 20° F (11° C) (you can monitor the
        temperature of the pile using a thermometer). Turning will result in more uniform decomposition, but is not
        absolutely necessary. To turn a pile, choose a site close-by and complete steps 1 and 2 as outlined on the pre-
        vious page. Move your pile with a pitchfork or locally available tool, by taking forkfuls off the top of the pile
        and putting them on top of the new roughage. Form the new pile by placing the less decomposed material
        towards the center of the new pile and the more decomposed material to the outer edges. Water after every

        layer you make, if needed, to establish good moisture (like a wrung out cloth). Turning will add air, restart -

        moisture level and let your pile cure.

        The pile should smell musty, then earthy. The materi -
        als should become harder to recognize, ending up as a
        crumbly, brown-black, woodsy-smelling fertile material
        that feels rich to the touch. Your pile should take about
        3-6 months to cure, depending on the climate. When

        you decide it is ready, put it onto already prepared beds,
        working it gently into the top 2-4 in (5-10 cm) of soil.
        The beds are now ready to plant. If you are not ready to
        use the compost, disassemble and dry the pile in a dry,
        airy and warm location, so it doesn’t continue decom -

        posing (over-decomposition reduces the nutrient value
        of the compost). Store compost dry; it will rehydrate
        when you use it.

                                             Notes to Refine Composting:


         If the material available has a lot of oils or readily available nutrients like coffee grounds, citrus peels, or
         manure, limit it to no more than 1/6th the volume of the completed pile.

         There are some things that are better to avoid putting into compost piles because they don’t decompose
         well. They have strong components that inhibit the decomposition process, or they contain undesirable
         eggs or seeds that can survive the curing process. Examples include: magnolia and eucalyptus leaves, poi-
         sonous plants, ivy, insect or disease infested plants, etc.

         The more mature material in a compost pile, the cooler and slower the decomposition. The resulting
         compost has higher amounts of stable organic matter that will have positive long-term affects in the soil.
         “Cool” composting is also better at maximizing
         the quantity of cured compost created per unit

         of built compost, which is part of the compost -
         ing goal.

         A yearly compost application for each growing
         bed is a general guideline.

         When applying compost, more is not always
         better. Remember to apply a quantity that can
         be sustainably produced by your farm.

         Because compost is a stable form of organic mat  -
         ter with long-term benefits for soil fertility and
         structure, it is preferable to put all crop mate -
         rial into a compost pile rather than turning crop
         matter directly into the soil.

         Compost supports soil fertility, but it may not
         contribute specific nutrients that a soil is lack -

         ing. For this reason, it is recommended to test
         your soil annually for basic and trace nutrients.
         If the soil is deficient, an annual addition of or -
         ganic amendments as recommended by the soil
         test can help stabilize the soil nutrients.
                                                              A compost sifter helps remove un-decomposed roughage.
         Caring for soil through composting and careful preparation will help hold onto these nutrients and over

         time you will find yourself needing to add fewer and fewer amendments.

                                             Goal: Create enhanced and
                                        uninterrupted root and plant growth


        T   he third leg of the stool is intensive planting. It creates enhanced and uninterrupted plant and root
        growth by transplanting seedlings in a close, off-set spacing pattern so theirffi leaves are barely - aching at m
        turity, creating a living mulch over the soil!

        The living mulchresults in a mini-climate between the plants and the soil, retaining moisture and protecting
        soil from wind and water exposure that can lead to erosion. Intensive planting also maximizes root material,
        which increases the biological activity and the organic matter in the soil. (When the soil is healthy, roots can

        be healthy; when roots are healthy, plants can be healthy.)

        Intensive planting limits weed growth, supporting the plants and saving labor. Additionally, the farmer
        benefits because the hexagonal pattern maximizes the number of plants in a given area, increasing yield.

        From above, the pattern looks like this:
                                                     Each plant is the same distance from all the plants around
                                                     it. In the center is the seedling and the circle around it is the
                                                     area the plant covers when it is full-grown. From the side,

                                                     the leaves should look like this:

        Experiment with the best spacing for your climate. For example, try lettuce 8, 10, 12, and 14 in (20, 25, 30, 35
         cm) apart and measure your yields per unit of area to compare production, soil coverage, and plant health. Re-

        Intensive planting is also utilized in the process of growing your own seedlings for transplanting. This farm-
        ing practice contributes to the sustainability of the farm through supporting a closed system (not buying
        seedlings). Seedlings can be grown in flats, in any container that drains well and is deep enough for roots
        (at least 3 in/ 7.5 cm), or in a nursery bed. Propagate seedlings in a way that allows them enough room to
        grow, while creating a good mini-climate over the flat, container or bed. Use the off-set spacing pattern, pu-t
        ting most seeds on 1 or 2 in (2.5 or 5 cm) spacing. If the seeds are too small to handle, scatter them evenly.
        To have enough space for the seedlings to develop properly, it may be necessary to move these seedlings to

        another flat, container or area on off-set spacing once they have germinated. This process is called “pricking
        out.” Most seedlings are pricked out on 1.5 or 2 in (3 or 5 cm) spacing.

      Using intensive planting, along with compost and deep soil preparation, is the foundation for a sustainable
      farm. These principles work together to create and support a healthy, vibrant soil, which can produce higher
      yields. A key in sustainable farming is to recognize that soil is the foundation of life! Farmers grow food that
      nurtures life; therefore, farmers must grow and honor the soil.

        C  ompanion planting strengthens the whole farm by crop and layout choices that support beneficial rela -
        tionships between plants, insects, and the soil.

        can teach you a lot about companion plants.

        Companion planting draws a diverse insect population to the garden by using plants of many types and
        colors that flower all-season long. Additionally, a place for insects to drink water and to be protected at night
        can be helpful. These actions will support a balance of beneficial insects that prey on insect pests and pollinate
        the crops. Lastly, choosing strong-scented plants, like marigolds, will help repel unwanted insects.

        Crop rotation is another way to use companion planting. Crop rotation means that crops of the same family
        are not planted in the same place within three years, creating diversity in the bed and over time AND mini-

        mizing disease pressure; therefore caring for the living soil and the whole garden.

                                            sustainable soil fertility


      “C   arbon” refers to plant material, also called “biomass,” that has a lot of complex cell structures and meets
      the criteria for mature material for compost building. Carbon farming promotes sustainable soil fertility by
      focusing on growing crops that produce a large amount of carbonaceous material (mature material) for com-
      posting. A farmer in tune with producing enough mature compost material will grow these crops in at least
      60% of the cultivated area. By focusing on growing enough compost material through choosing carbon--ro
      ducing crops, a farmer becomes more self-sufficient, relying on his/her own compost for soil fertility instead
      of buying resources from off of the farm.


      Some crops of importance are: maize, sorghum, amaranth, quinoa, millet, rye, wheat, barley, rice, oats, and
      sunflowers. An important production goal for mature compost material is an average of 30 lb (13.5 kg) of air-
      dry material per 100 ft² (10 m²) bed. A sustainable farming systemffi focuses on crops that have this potential.

      In addition, carbon farming has a diet element. The important cereal
      crops mentioned above also produce an edible seed. Emphasizing crops            HINT:

      ered and supports sustainable soil fertility with more compost material.
      Keeping something growing in the soil at all times is an important farming practice for soil building and
      compost material, worth the extra planning it requires.

        “C   alorie” refers to the energy that is found in food we eat. Calories are essential for human life and are in
        all food to some degree. Calorie farming produces a complete diet in the smallest space possible by focusing

        on special root crops that are calorie-dense and yield well in a small area. These specific crops are: potatoes,
        sweet potatoes, parsnips, leeks, garlic, Jerusalem artichoke, and salsify. A farm with 30% of its area in special
        root crops maximizes its area-efficient production of calories and can grow a complete diet in the smallest
        space possible.

        After accounting for carbon crops and special root crops, the remaining 10% of area can grow vegetable crops

        for a nutritionally diverse diet and a modest income. Orange and dark green vegetables can help boost im -
        portant vitamins and minerals in the diet, especially Vitamins A and C and iron.

                      PRINCIPLE 7: OPEN-POLLINATED SEEDS 

                                      Goal: Maximize seed production and
                                       quality and preserve genetic diversity


      U   sing open-pollinated (OP) seeds allows the farmer to save seeds on the farm, providing for future crops
      through growing healthy, locally acclimatized, fresh seeds. This helps create a self-sufficient closed system by
      reducing dependence on large or small seed vendors, and by saving money. It is generally possible to grow all
      the seeds necessary for next year’s garden in about 3% additional area.

      Seed savers must start with OP seeds. This is because hybrid
      seeds have been crossed already, and do not have pure genes;

      seeds saved from hybrid plants will not produce offspring that
      are true to type (have appropriate characteristics for the variety).
      Only offspring from OP seeds will be true to type.

      Saving seeds requires learning how specific crops reproduce.
      Some crops produce seed in one growing season (annuals),
      while others require two seasons for seed production (bienni -
      als). Some crops can self-pollinate while others require pollen
      from another plant to produce seed (cross-pollination). This

      information will help you learn how to grow the seed.

      When growing seed in the garden, the farmer must pay atten -
      tion to the purity of the seed. Pure seed will produce true to
      type offspring, keeping the variety strong and consistent. Seeds
      from some crops, like those that require cross-pollination, are
      naturally more likely to become impurely crossed (hybrids)
      with a different variety or crop. Some plants will even cross

      with wild relatives. To attend to seed purity it is wise to grow
      most crops for seed at a good distance from other varieties and
      other crops in the same family. For crops that cross readily, like
      corn, it may be advisable to grow only one variety each sea-
      son—and that variety 2,000 ft (610 m) from other corn variet-
      ies. Another method of isolating seed from potential crossing
      is to grow varieties that mature at different times, so the pollen
      has no opportunity to cross.                                              A pollinator at work


      In addition to purity, genetic diversity is an important practice of good seed saving. Always save seed from
      a minimum of 5 plants, preferably more. (For corn at least 50 plants are needed.) You can never save seed
      from too many plants (of the same variety). In this way your seed harvest has a wider range of genes and
      traits. This will result in a healthy and diverse crop that will be better able to deal with various challenges of
      life, insects, climate, etc. Over time, seed saved consistently will be more acclimatized to local conditions and
      be more genetically adapted to the area, a benefit of careful seed saving.

                A Farmer's Mini-Handbook: GROW BIOINTENSIVE Sustainable Mini-Farming                        12                                                         ¦



         Each type of seed generally has an average number of years it is able to germinate. A seed saver must attend
         to seed storage in such a way that the viability (ability to germinate) and vitality of the seed are supported.
         Conditions that are ideal for seed storage are the opposite of conditions that are good for germination. For

         example, seeds stored in airtight containers in cool and dark places are likely to remain viable longer than
         seeds stored in open containers in warm, sunny places.

                                                   GB Farmer’s Challenge:
          Start small and grow one crop out to seed the first season. Start with a simple crop like dry beans or lettuce. Add
                                other crops over time to produce most of or all of your farm’s seeds.


         Using companion planting, farming for carbon and calories, and using openffi-pollinated seeds are like cho-  os
         ing the strongest material to make the three-legged stool, so it will truly last. They are actions of intention.
         They allow GB to produce enough compost and food to truly build and sustain the soil, to feed the farmer
         and help the farm approach sustainability.

                     PRINCIPLE 8: WHOLE SYSTEM APPROACH 

                                        Goal: Integrate all the principles
                                        into your garden to create balance


      GB      is a unified farming method, withall eight principles playing an important role in creating a thriving
      mini-ecosystem that sustains itself and its farmers. The closer you can come to a closed system, the more
      sustainable your farming methods will be.

      If, instead of using all the principles on your farm, some principles are used and others are discarded, your
      soil may eventually be in worse condition than when you began. For example, deep soil cultivation partnered
      with intensive planting but without the benefits of compost may strip the soil of fertility and structure.
      Similarly, adding more than a sustainably produced amount of compost or extra biological fertilizer may
      improve crop yields for a few years, but lead to soil imbalances that could cause future insect and disease issues

      and a less-healthy soil. Not growing enough compost material on your own farm may be depleting your soil
      for lack of the compost needed to hold minerals in your soil. Buying materials to build compost may deplete
      someone else’s land.

      The benefits of patient and consistent work necessary to create the healthy soil and the crop diversity inherent
      in the GB method will be evident over time. Though crops may struggle during the first years in challenging
      soil, or insect pests may be an initial problem, careful attention to all eight principles will transform the farm
      into a vigorous ecosystem that grows healthy, high-yielding crops and can keep insect pests in balance.


      GB requires farmers to act with thought and foresight, recognizing that the farm itself is part of a oreater ec-
      system that should be thriving. Keeping half of your land in the wild, if possible, nurtures the plant, insect,
      and animal diversity that surround the farm and provides a buffer that allows it to exist and thrive. In urban
      settings, perhaps an area for native flowers, shrubs, and trees can be a welcome space for visitors that also helps
      support a larger ecosystem.

      This final principle is the essential top of the stool so that, when allffi other principles are considered, you can

      sit and rest with the satisfaction that the stool is well formed, strong and beautiful!

                                        Ultimate GB Farmer’s Challenge:
        When considering any one aspect of the garden, always remember that all things are connected and that only a
       healthy soil will produce healthy crops. Only a healthy system can sustain a healthy soil. Challenge yourself and
                        your neighbors to become aware of and to nurture theWHOLE ecosystem!

      GROW BIOINTENSIVE Sustainable Mini-Farming is an exciting recognition that farmers are important

      people who care for other people and for the land. Be creative as you remember each of the goals and tork-
      ward creating a thriving mini-ecosystem on your farm. Ask yourself if your actions uphold the goal and move
      you toward sustainability. Be patient; knowledge and skill are things that are built by practice, dedication,
      and time—just like soil. Ultimately, start small, do the best with what you have, and learn from everything
      you do. As you master this, you hold a beautiful seed. As a farmer, this seed of knowledge will be in your
      hands to nurture and to share!

      Maximize productivity per unit of water and other resources used while\n                         enhancing
      and maintaining soil fertility.\n\n\n\n                                    INTRODUCTION\n\n
      \      The globe is becoming increasingly desertified. At the rate desertification
      is increasing,\nabout 2/3 of 1% annually, the planet could be entirely desert
      in as little as 70 eationalhN\nGeographichas published two issues on soil and
      its loss—November 1979 and September 2008.\nThe United Nations Food and Agriculture
      Organization has noted that, in just 14 years, about two-\nthirds of the world
      population, about 5 billion people, will be dietarily at risk due to limited
      water\navailability.\n       Up to 80% of the water used by people in the world
      is used in the overall agricultural\nsystems. With GROW BIOINTENSIVE   ®Sustainable
      Mini-Farming practices used properly, as little as\n67% to 88% the water is
      needed per pound of food produced compared with conventional\napproaches.\n
      \      Ecology Action has decided to publish the knowledge, concepts and practices
      it has\naccumulated about growing more food with less waterover the last 40
      years, because we feel they\n\noffer practical hope. Even though many of the
      practices described here have not been experienced\nyet by us, they have grown
      out of the experience of others. It is an exciting time to learn these\npractices
      and begin!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                             1
      \                      HOW WATER MOVES THROUGH THE SOIL\n\n        If precipitation
      falls on unsaturated earth, it percolates into the soil and may or may not\nreach
      the water table. If the earth is saturated, the precipitation runs off into
      streams, lakes and\noceans. Water is drawn into plants, crops, weeds and trees.
      Minerals are extracted as the water\nmoves through the plant, and excess water
      moves from the leaves back into the atmosphere via\n\ntranspiration. Water may
      also move out of the soil via evaporation.\n\n                              WATER

      The Nature and Properties of Soils, 12th ed., p. 223.\n\nThe goal is to retain
      half of rainfall for plant use in properly prepared soil.\n\nThe amount of water
      held in a plant is very small compared to the water lost by transpirationS.o\nhow
      does a plant acquire water?\n    • through the capillary movement of soil water
      to plant roots: the root hair takes in water and\n        creates tension, so
      water flows into the plant.\n\n    • through roots and root hairs growing out
      into moist soil, looking for nutrients; new root-soil\n        contacts are
      constantly being established.\n    • through root distribution: there is a high
      proportion of root absorption of water in the upper\n        12 inches (30 cm)
      of soil (except for perennials like alfalfa and trees).\n    • through root-soil
      contact: corn roots, for example, swell to fill the pore space when water is\n
      \       adequate and shrink when it is not.\n\n\n\n                            SOIL
      — HOW WATER IS RETAINED\n\n• Organic matterin soil helps to retain moisture.
      For good crop yields, a fertile soil needs 4% to\n6% soil organic matter in
      temperate climates, 3% in tropical climates. Many agricultural soils in the\nUS
      have as little as 0.5% to 1% soil organic matter. If the organic matter can
      be increased to 2% (of\nvolume) in the upper 7 to 11 inches (18 to 28 cm) of
      soil,as little as one-quarter the water is\nneededfor good plant growth. Compost
      can hold 6 times its weight in water and can reduce the\namount of water needed
      by as much as 75%.   3\n\n\n1The Nature and Properties of Soils, 1929, p. 197.\n2The

      \       100 pounds of dry soil with 1.5-2% organic matter can hold 35-45 pounds
      of water.\n        100 pounds of dry soil with 4-5% organic matter can hold
      165-195 pounds of water.\n                (~4.5 times more)       (An Acres
      U.S.A. Primer, p. 94)\n\n• Shaded soil can reduce evaporation by 13% to 63%.
      This is possible even in arid regions if the\nsoil is covered. InGROW BIOINTENSIVE
      \    , the use of close spacing, which creates a “living mulch”,\nimproves the
      mini-climate for the plants and reduces water loss from the soil.\n        Wider
      spacing for plants is often suggested for areas with less rainfall. In point
      of fact,\n\nplants spaced more widely provide less of the \"living mulch\" mini-climate
      made by living plants, so\nmore soil surface is exposed, and the amount of evaporation
      of moisture from the soil increases.\n\n• A good balance of nutrients in the
      soil can reduce transpiration by 10% to 75%.        5\n\n        As long ago
      as 1699, an experiment was done in England. The question was: To\n        what
      extent does the amount of transpiration depend on the nutrients in soil water?\n
      \       Plants were watered with rainwater (comparatively clean in those days!),
      spring\n        water, and water from the Thames River (notoriously dirty!).
      The amount of water\n        transpired was 192.3 g, 163.6 g and 159.5 g, respectively.
      When the plants were\n        watered with dirty water, they took up 20% less
      water; that is to say, they found the\n        nutrients they needed and required
      less water.        (Widtsoe,Dry Farming,p. 180)\n\nThis indicates the importance
      of testing the soil and adding the necessary nutrients to keep the soil\nbalanced.
      These nutrients may be added by growing legumes, by alley-cropping with nitrogen-\n\nfixing
      trees, by good rotation practices, and by adding the appropriate soil amendments,
      if\nnecessary.\n        In fact, theGROW BIOINTENSIVE        method emphasizes
      all three of these aspects that\nwork together to reduce the amount of water
      needed to grow food. On the average, with\nBiointensive practices,as little
      as one-eighth the water per pound of vegetables   and one-third the\nwater per
      pound of grainsare needed, compared with commercial agriculture.\n\n\n                              HOW
      MUCH WATER IS NEEDED?\n\n        In 1991, the World Bank said that 20% of the
      total land area is arable land. In 1993, they\n\nsaid that 84% of world’s arable
      land is rain-fed.\n        75% of world land where crops grow gets approximately
      10 inches (25 cm) of rain or more\nper 4-month growing season, enough to grow
      food with good techniques. Less than 10 inches (25\ncm) of rainfall is not suitable
      for reliable food productionand “generally does not support\nagriculture”. 66%
      of the world’s land mass gets more than 20 inches of annual rainfall; 34% gets\n20
      inches or less in arid/semi-arid climates.8\n        Approximately 32% of the
      global harvest comes from 16% of cropland that is irrigated; this\narea is rapidly
      becoming salinized. 7.5 inches of rain/water is needed to minimize salt build-up.\n\n\n\n4

      (i.e., yields four times the U.S. average): 10 inches (7 cm) to percolate beyond\nthe
      root systems and evaporate, 10 inches retained in the soil for the crop. About
      0.17 inch (0.4 cm)\nper day (20 inches ÷ 120 days) equals approximately10 gallons
      (38 l) per day per 100 sq ft (9.3 sq\nm) of growing area. The needed rain can
      fall before or during the growing season. If only 10 inches\nof rain falls,
      only half the water is available for 4-month crops; this is not enough.\n\n
      \       Properly prepared and maintained soil should retain 2.75 inches (25
      cm) of water in the\nupper 11 inches (28 cm), possibly 6 inches (15 cm) in double-dug
      beds. Soil prepared 7 inches\n(17.8 cm) deep can hold 1.75 inches (4.4 cm) of
      water. 1.75 inches of water in a 100-sq-ft bed\ncomes to 128 gal (33.8 liters),
      approximately 12 gal (45 liters) per 100 sq ft (10 sq m) per day. This\namount
      would last approximately 10.6 days. Only 30% of the total land area in Kenya
      receives this\nmuch.\n        Numerous experiments done in the early 1900s found
      that water in arid regions can move\nas deep as 8 ft (the depth reached by soil
      augurs at that time), and very possibly deeper than that,\nwhether the main
      precipitation falls in winter or summer.It is important to maintain a minimum
      of\nsoil moisture deep in the soil in order for the subsequent precipitation
      to be fully utilized. If soil\nmoisture is limited, a clean fallow, “resting
      the ground with proper cultivation for one season” or\neven two seasons, allows
      the rainfall of more than one season to accumulate deep in the soil,\nprovided
      no crops or weeds are grown.   10\n\n\n                                     SOME
      COMPARISONS\n\n\n        One of Ecology Action’s goals in 1972 was to discover
      how much water Alan Chadwick’s\nBiodynamic/French Intensive Method used per
      unit of area. Chadwick estimated one-half compared\nwith conventional practices.
      His apprentices thought it used much more than this—because of the\namount of
      time spent watering. Our tests have ultimately shown tha    tROW BIOINTENSIVE\nSustainable
      Mini-Farming has the potential to use as much as 67% less water (1/3) per pound
      of\ngrain and seed crops produced compared with conventional farming, and as
      much as 88% less\nwater (1/8) for vegetables. Not allowing for evaporation,
      this means one year of water could last for\n3 to 8 years, respectively—a very
      important factor. The UN-FAO has noted that by 2025, with\ncurrent practices,
      about two-thirds of the world’s people (about 5 billion) may well not have enough\nwater
      to properly grow sufficient food to sustain themselves. 11\n        Table Afollowing
      shows Ecology Action’s water use per unit of area and time at our first\nsite
      on Syntex Corporation land in the Stanford University Industrial Park in Palo
      Alto, California.\nThe top- and subsoils at the garden site had been scraped
      away earlier as part of a construction\nproject. Note that, when we began growing
      crops in our C-horizon molisol soil mterial, we used the\nsame amount of water
      at the hottest time of the year per unit of area and time as conventional\npractices
      used year-round, including the cooler times of the year.\n\n        Note also
      that, as the soil improved over time, the water requirement dropped dramatically.\nThe
      test in 1977 involved 20 different 100-sq-ft growing beds with crops directly
      sown,\ntransplanted, and at various stages of growth, including almost mature.
      One bed averaged over two\nweeks used 5 gallons of water per bed per day, another
      used 30 gallons, and the remaining 18 used\na daily average of 10 gallons. The
      meter used measured with accuracy to 1/10 of a gallon.\n        Table Blooks
      at another way of conceptualizing water use: in terms of how many 5,000-\ngallon
      (20,000-liter) swimming pools would be needed for the water to grow all the
      calories for one\nperson annually. 45-day Japanese millet, a C-4 crop, is the
      most effective. C-4 crops, such as millet,\n\n9\n  Widtsoe, J.A. 1911. Dry Farming:

      much less water in the production of calories and carbon. Carrots\nare surprisingly
      water-efficient. The only challenge is that a person needs to eat 15.3 lb of
      carrots\ndaily to have sufficient calories. Women can reasonably consume a maximum
      of 5.5 lb of food a\nday and prefer as little as 3 lb. Men have a reasonable
      maximum of 6 lb and prefer as little as 4 lb.\nNote that the animal product,
      hamburger, uses 46 to 92 times more water than 45-day Japanese\nmillet.\n        Tables

      2.4 to 9.6 times the calories per\nunit of water, depending on the method and
      the crop chosen as well as the soil and climate.\n       Choosing crops that
      consume less water is important. Native Seeds/SEARCH has a\n\nselection of arid
      varieties. Drought-tolerant flowers include globe amaranth, tithonia, and a
      special\ntype of cosmos. Drought-hardy herbs include sage, rosemary, and lavender.
      Native plants are\nadapted to the area in which they thrive. Mesquite is particularly
      drought-hardy.\n       If water or any other resource is limited, it is important
      to use that resource in the most\nefficient way possible. A good example of
      this is illustrated in a report from the Shri A M M\nMurugappa Chettiar Research
      Centre in Madras, India, about a project carried out in rural India in\nthe
      1980s. Village women with little education or experience with kitchen gardens
      were taught to\ngrow vegetables using the Biointensive method. The village was
      in its second year of drought, with\na general shortage of manure and water.
      Eight women kept data for the project. The sizes of their\ngrowing areas ranged
      from 140 to 900 square feet. Manure was added before bed preparation at\nrates
      ranging from 0.4 to 4.7 lb per sq ft. Daily water use was measured and ranged
      from 5.7 to\n\n13.5 gallons per 100 sq ft. The woman with the smallest garden
      (140 sq ft) was able to add the\nmost manure (at the rate of 4.7 lb per 100
      sq ft) and use the greatest amount of water (13.5 gallons\nper 100 sq ft per
      day). The yields for two of the crops from her garden compared to the other\ngardens
      were 2.6 to 5.3 times higher for greens and 1.7 to 4.8 times higher for radish.
      Using her\nlimited resources in a smaller area allowed this woman to have a
      more productive garden.\n       The Native American Navajo culture in the southwestern
      United States has found an\napproach and seeds that enable them to grow corn
      with as little as 3 inches of rainfall. The seeds are\nplanted as deep as 24
      inches where there is moisture for germination, and the sand above acts like
      a\nmulch. The plants only grow about two feet high, and each plant produces
      one large ear of corn\nseeds. In spite of the limitations, the overall productivity
      is significant.\n       If clay soil is available, up to one inch may be added
      to the garden soil and mixed into the\n\nupper 12 inches of the soil. This increases
      the soil's capacity to hold water, and the clay also\ngenerally contains growth-enhancing
      trace minerals.\n       As you can see in Table D following, a large amount
      of water can be saved by raising\nseedlings in flats—an amount sufficient for
      growing as much as half or all of the food for one\nperson annually. In an increasingly
      desertified world, this will be important. This technique also\nleaves the growing
      beds free for extra time during which other crops for diet and compost biomass\ncan
      be brought to maturity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                               9

      of this draft information sheet is to encourage water conservation in two ways:\n•
      by raising seedlings in flats for transplanting in contrast with direct sowing
      of crops, and\n\n• by growing 37/40 of the major calorie-producing area in a
      very water-conserving crop. Other\ndiet designs are possible that are significantly
      water-efficient. Forms 7-10 in Ecology Action’s\nBooklet #31 need to be used
      for this design and other designs to ensure that:\n• all the nutrients a person
      requires annually, and\n• all the carbon and nitrogen needed to provide sufficient
      compost annually are provided by the\ndesign ultimately used.\n\n\n(A) Water

      \                                STORE WATER IN THE SOIL\n\n        The cheapest
      and most efficient way to store water is in the soil itself—a well prepared,\nliving
      soil. Compacted soil holds less water because pore spaces are smaller. Plant
      roots have more\ndifficulty penetrating a compacted soil, and there is less
      air available for plant roots when water fills\nthe pore spaces.\n        The
      GROW BIOINTENSIVE      technique of double-digging loosens the soil to a depth
      of 24\ninches, which facilitates water infiltration. In areas with limited water,
      the technique of triple-digging\nto a depth of 36 inches will allow the soil
      to hold up to 9 inches of net water. While it is true that a\nlooser soil allows
      more water to flow through the soil to be stored, that loose soil may also slow\ndown
      the capillary movement of water to the plant roots. It is therefore essential
      to provide an\nadequate level of soil organic matter with the addition of compost.
      A complete texturizing double-\ndig, as described inHow to Grow More Vegetables
      \    , can be used once only to improve a\nchallenging soil. It uses two times
      the sustainable amount of compost, but the higher biomass yields\nthat result
      will compensate over time.\n        Plant after the soil has been moistened
      by thesecondgood rain or when you know that the\nsoil will have 10 inches of
      stored or potential rain for the growing season. (See p. 3 for\neffectiveness
      details.)\n\n        When watering, focus on watering the soil, rather than
      the plants. If the soil has adequate\nwater, it will be available to the plants.
      The best time to water is in the evening, at night or at the\ncoolest time of
      the day.\n\n\n                                 RAINWATER HARVESTING\n\n        Rainwater
      harvesting techniques are techniques to collect run-off or flood water for storage\nin
      the soil profile or tanks for crops, trees, or fodder. Farming in dry regions
      is made possible by\nmeans of run-off rainwater from whatever type of catchment
      or ephemeral stream. The benefits\ninclude:\n        • improving crop production—or
      making it possible (the soil stays moist longer, therefore\nsoil life is stimulated,
      therefore more stable humus, nutrient availability, water-holding capacity)\n
      \       • reducing soil erosion\n        • replenishing aquifers used for irrigation\n
      \       • improving soil fertility.\n Three basic landscape elements are necessary
      for the most effective rainwater harvesting:\n        a) The landscape surface
      and soil conditions must be able to produce run-off.\n        b) The landscape
      surface must include variations in elevation to allow water to flow, but not\nso
      much flow as to cause erosion.\n        c) The collection areas must have a
      soil horizon deep enough and of a suitable structure to\nstore sufficient run-off
      for crop production, that is, organic matter and roots.\n        The methods
      range from small- to large-scale:micro-catchment systems,which will be\nthe
      focus of this discussion; terraced stream-bed systems, hillside conduit systems,
      small dams with\nspillways, and large-scale diversion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14\n15“Water

      sunken beds are used; these are angled beds with edge lips.\n\n\n\n• Crescent-shaped
      micro-catchments; in French: ‘demi-lunes’; in Spanish: ‘medias lunas’\n      This
      technique consists of semi-circular basins with small ridges in a regular pattern,\nconstructed
      in rows from about 10 ft (3 m) to about 20 ft (6 m) apart on the contour. They
      can vary\nfrom 4 to 20 inches (10-50 cm) high, with the diameter from 6.5 ft
      (2 m) in Burkina Faso to about\n20 ft (6 m) in Kenya. The basins are offset
      16 catch run-off water. A slope of 3% to 7% (3-7 ft per\n100 ft) is good for
      most micro-catchments. One person can easily dig out the half-circle,\nthrowing
      the soil from inside the catchment onto the low wall that retains the run-off
      water.\n\n\n16\n  David Cleveland and Daniela Soleri,Food from Dryland Gardens,
      CPFE, 1991.\n\n                                                 12      Design
      considerations involve the catchment:cultivated area ratio. The total size of
      the basin\nand the catchment depends on the rainfall patterns, the water needs
      of the crop, and the\ncharacteristics of the catchment area (i.e. texture of
      soil).\n      In one project with trees, the tree survival rate with micro-catchments
      was 72% after 3 years,\ncompared to 52% without micro-catchments. The growth
      rate was 3.2 times faster, and improved\nconditions allowed for grass re-establishment.
      \ 17\n      Various crops are suitable for micro-catchments:\n– Sorghum needs
      17.7-25.5 inches (450-650 mm) of rain for maximum yields and can withstand\ntemporary
      waterlogging. It also has several mechanisms for responding to drought.\n– Pearl
      millet needs less water than sorghum, tolerates drought better and is less sensitive
      to low\n\nsoil fertility. However, it does not tolerate waterlogging, so it
      can be planted in the drier parts of the\nbasins.\n– Grain legumes (e.g. cowpeas)
      do not tolerate waterlogging, but many of them are drought-\ntolerant. Their
      rapid maturity is an advantage, as they can mature with residual soil moisture.\n–
      Fodder and grasses are usually much more drought-tolerant than food crops but
      produce a lower\neconomic return.\n–Trees can be successfully grown with micro-catchments.
      Many trees are not resistant to\nwaterlogging, so care must be taken to plant
      them in the drier areas of the micro-catchment.   18\n\n        i.) In Tahoua,
      Niger(650 km NE of Niamey), the average rainfall is 16 inches (400 mm),\nand
      the vegetation, on the edge of the desert steppe, is very sparse. A 1986 reportdescribes
      the\ncrescent-shaped micro-catchments: 13 feet (4 m) apart, 13 feet (4 m) in
      diameter, 16 inches (40 cm)\ndeep or less, with 13 feet (4 m) between the rows.\n
      \   ~ Sorghumwas planted and produced yields ofup to 267 lb per acre (300 kg
      per hectare),0.6\n    lb (0.27 kg) per 100 sq ft, compared to the U.S. average
      yield of   6.8 lb per 100 sq ft. However,\n    the yield from the soil, if there
      had been no micro-catchments, would have been much lower.\n        In addition,
      at the rate of 267 lb per acre and assuming 1,538 calories per pound, this\n
      \   sorghum yield would provide approximately 411,000 caloriesn       ,early
      half of the calories for\n    one person annually, assuming 2,400 calories per
      day. Had Biointensive practices been used in\n    the growing secttion of each
      micro-catchment, the yields would have been higher.\n        At the rate of
      the U.S. average, 6.8 lb per 100 sq ft (2,962 lb per acre), and with the same\n
      \   assumptions as above, an acre would produce enough calories annually for
      more than 5 people.\n\n        Initial testing of this technique was successful,
      interest was high, and 15,000 were built.\n    ~ Yields ofmillet were 0.5 lb
      per 100 sq ft (250 kg per ha; 223 lb per acre) inpoor rainfall\n    years, and
      up to 600 to 800 kg per hectare (536 to 714 lb per acre) 1   (.2 to 1.6 lbper
      100 sq ft)\n    in good yearsin fields where rainfed agriculture was not possible
      at all, compared to the U.S.\n    average yield of 7.1 lb per 100 sq ft for
      proso millet. However, the yield from the soil, if there\n    had been no micro-catchments,
      would have been much lower.\n        In addition, assuming a rate of 625 lb
      per acre in agood yearand 1,522 calories per pound\n    (the figure for pearl
      millet), this millet yield would provide approximately 951,250 calories,\n    more
      than enough calories for one person annually      , assuming 2,400 calories
      per day. Had\n    Biointensive practices been used in the growing secttion of
      each micro-catchment, the yields\n    would have been higher.\n        At the
      rate of the U.S. average for proso millet, 7.1 lb per 100 sq ft (3,093 lb per
      acre), and\n    with the same assumptions as above, an acre would produce enough
      calories annually for more\n    than 5 people.\n\n\n\n\n\n17\n18Chris Reij et

      Ourihamiza, Niger(north of Tahoua), a project was begun in 1974. Average rainfall\n\nwas
      7.8 inches (200 mm); the wet season went from June to September, with a peak
      in August.\nSorghum, millet and cowpeaswere grown in demi-lunes with a radius
      of 6.5 ft (2 m); the bunds\nwere 10 inches (25 cm) high, 20 inches (50 cm) wide
      at the base. There were 313 demi-lunes per\nhectare. The catchment:cultivated
      area ratio was 4:1. The yields wer1      e.2 lb(0.5 kg) per 100 sq ft\n(600
      kg per ha).\n\n      ii.) In Turkana District, Kenya, an arid region in northwestern
      Kenya, the average rainfall is\n8 to 24 inches (200 to 600 mm). They dug basins
      6 m in diameter, with rows 3 to 6 m apart on the\ncontour. Leguminous trees
      were planted on the perimeter of the catchment and used for fuelwood,\n\nfodder,
      and fencing material. Drought-hardy crops were planted in the basins. Ther21was
      an\nincrease in the soil organic matter, aided by the addition of livestock
      manure.\n\n      iii.) In theCape Verde Islands, the microcatchments were generally
      10 ft (3 m) by 10 ft,\nsometimes reinforced with stones. The semi-circular basins
      were built on the contour, with grass,\nstones, or trees at the edges.22\n\n\n•
      “Zay”\n      The “zay” technique is a form of pitting, used in Burkina Faso
      and the Cape Verde Islands.\n\nThe water-harvesting effect works best on slopes
      below 2%. The procedure is to dig out holes 2 to\n6 inches (5 to 15 cm) deep,
      4 to 12 inches (10 to 30 cm) in diameter, 20 to 39 inches (50 to 100 cm)\napart;
      the catchment:cultivated area is 1 to 3:1. Manure and grass are mixed with some
      of the dug-\nout soil and put into the zay. The rest of the soil is used to
      form a small dike downslope of the pit.\nZay are used in combination with stone
      bunds that slow down run-off.\n      Although quite labor-intensive, this technique
      is very effective where nothing will grow in\ndegraded barren soils. Millet
      or sorghum yields of 1000+ kg per hectare (2 lb per 100 sq ft) were\nachieved
      in years with average rainfall where average cereal yields on cultivated lands
      were 400 to\n500 kg per hectare (0.8 to 1 lb per 100 sq ft).  23\n\n      In
      Burkina Faso,farmers withcrusted barren land break the crust and dig pits 12
      inches (30\ncm) in diameter, 8 inches (20 cm) deep. They add manure to the pits;
      this attracts termites that\ndigest the manure and dig holes, thus increasing
      soil fertility and infiltration capacity. This\ntechnique permits the concentration
      of water and nutrients. Eventually a wider area is rehabilitated,\nand land
      that previously had little value is now in demand.   25\n      In the Illela
      district ofTahoua, Niger, rainfall is 250 to 600 mm (10 to 24 inches). Zay,\ncalled
      “tassa”, are constructed with a diameter of 10 to 16 inches (25 to 40 cm), 6
      to 12 inches (15\nto 30 cm) deep, 31 to 39 inches (80 to 100 cm) apart. The
      excavated soil is placed downslope, and\nmanure is put into the pits at the
      rate of 2 to 4T per ha (9 to 18 lb per 100 sq ft). The yields on\nuntreated
      lands in this area are nil. With zay, in a year with  goodrainfall, yields of
      500-600 kg per\n\nha are possible, wit26some yields up to 800 to 1,000 kg per
      ha (1 to 1.2 lb per 100 sq ft, up to 1.6 to\n2 lb per 100 sq ft).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n20

      ridges” refers to the use of ridges for field crops common in West Africa. To
      make\na tied ridge, construct smaller perpendicular cross-ridges every few meters,
      lower than the primary\nridges so rain will not wash out the main ridges. One
      advantage of this technique is the increased\nwater availability over time as
      the water is held in place rather than passing through. Therefore, root\ngrowth
      increases, and there is more vegetative growth. One disdavantage may be possible\nwaterlogging
      with excessive rainfall.\n      In a study of cowpeas done in Ouagadougou, Burkina
      Faso (Upper Volta), in 1987 by the\nIITA, this method was shown to improve yields
      of cotton, maize, millet, and sorghum.\n\n\n                          Study

      Living terraces\n        Vegetative methods of soil and moisture conservation
      are carried out with Leucaena for the\ntropics and Tagasaste for temperate areas
      (nitrogen-fixing), as well as Vetiver, and other plants.\n        Vetiver grasscan
      be used for moisture conservation in-situ (in the natural or original\nposition).
      These vegetative barriers stabilize fields and protect them from high-intensity
      storms. In\ntropical soils, the roots may go 16 ft (5 m) or more deep. Vetiver
      grass is native to India where it\nis called ‘khus’. It has been in use for
      over 100 years as a vegetative contour barrier to stabilize the\nsoil. It adapts
      to a wide range of soils and climates (from the Himalayas to the desert). It
      will grow\nwith as much as 5,000 mm (200 inches) of rainfall and as little as
      250 mm (10 inches), but does\nbetter with 700 mm (28 inches) or more; it can
      survive drought. Studies show it does not become a\n\nweed or compete with food
      crops. It has not proven to be a host for pests or diseases of plant crops.\n
      \       In India, hedges a29 kept short (12-20 inches [30-50 cm]) so seed heads
      never form; the\nclippings are fed to cattle.\n        It takes 3 seasons for
      the hedges to establish in arid areas; they are permanent once\nestablished.
      It takes only 5 months for them to establish in the humid tropics. Once established,
      a\nVetiver hedge will stop sheet erosion; it slows run-off and filters out silt
      while the water oozes\nthrough and the silt spreads back across the field. Vetiver
      grass grows through the silt, eventually\nforming a natural terrace.\n        In
      Fiji, with 50% slopes (100% slope—45°; 50% slope—22.5°), terraces approximately10\nto
      13 ft (3 to 4 m) formed behind grass hedges. In China, hedges on 60% slopes
      protect tea and\ncitrus crops. In St. Vincent (West Indies), hedges used for
      50+ years formed natural terraces\naveraging 13 ft (4 m) high.\n        The
      vertical interval between terraces is 6.5 ft (2 m).\n        The width of the
      hedges can be controlled at about 20 inches (50 cm), so only a small part\nof
      a farmer’s field is out of production.\n        The Vetiver Network International
      has detailed information on their website:\nwww.vetiver.org.\n\n\n\n\n27\n28“Tied

      for the steep hillsides of South Africa, where no stone is\navailable for terracing.
      There are heavy summer rains (40 inches [1016 mm] per year) and dry\nwinters.
      A trench is dug 6 ft (1.8 m) long, 4 ft (1.2 m) deep; the topsoil is put to
      one side. Materials\nare layered in the trench: 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7.6 cm)
      of topsoil in the bottom; 12 inches (30.5 cm) of\ngrass, millet/maize straw,
      domestic wastes; 12 inches (30.5 cm) soil; 12 inches (30.5 cm) organic\nmaterials.
      The topsoil is used for the final layer. The first crop to be planted is Sunn
      Hemp\n(Crotallaria juncea), a grain legume, which sends its roots through the
      layers; the roots hold the\nsoil and release nitrogen. The foliage is cut for
      cattle or plowed under. The second crop is taro, a\nroot crop that does not
      require much nitrogen. Subsequent crops can be maize, millet, carrots, etc.\nRainwater
      is conserved in the organic matter in the trench for year-round production.

      advantages of this\ntechnique are that the soil temperature is lower for the
      microbial life and organic matter, and water is\nconserved. A disadvantage is
      that the structure of the soil is disrupted.\n\n\n• Dry gravel farming in China\n
      \       In China, gravel/stone mulch has been used for centuries. The gravel
      from loess bluffs is\nspread thickly (4 to 6 inches [10 to 15 cm]) over the
      soil to hold in the moisture from any rain.\nWheat is planted under the rock
      layer. No watering is done. The wheat sprouts between the stones.\nThe wheat
      is harvested by hand; the roots are removed to keep them from obstructing future
      crops.\nSomehow, the stones collect any moisture condensation from the humidity
      at night, and moisture\nseeps into soil and plant roots below.32\n\n\n• Anasazi
      gravel mulch\n        Six hundred years ago, theAnasazi in northern New Mexico
      were dryland farmers who\ndepended on snow and very limited rainfall, 2 to 10
      inches (5 to 25 cm) per year, to grow their\ncrops. They used a system of gravel
      mulch, with pea- to fist-sized pieces of gravel up to 6 inches\n(15 cm) deep.
      They grew corn, beans, squash, and cotton. Researcher Tim Maxwell replicated
      this\nsystem and found that the gravel mulch retains moisture in the soil three
      times longer than it is\nretained in unmulched soil, regulates the temperature
      of the plant roots, prevents erosion, and\nextends the growing season.  33\n\n\n\n32\n

      Stone mulch\n      A mulch made from stones can protect the soil from drying
      and prevent erosion from wind\nand water. It also helps to precipitate more
      dew. J.I. Rodale’s bookStone Mulching in the Garden\ndiscusses this technique.
      The temperature under the stones can be 10 degrees higher than the\noutside
      surface, so the growing season is extended. There is good biological (microbe,
      earthworm)\nactivity under the stones, encouraging good soil structure. One
      method uses 2-ft-wide stone\nsections, interspersed with 1-ft-wide beds of compost
      6 inches deep.\n\n\n• Vertical mulch\n\n        A vertical mulch can be created
      on gently sloping land by digging a narrow trench and\nfilling it with upright
      stems of crops such as corn, millet, sorghum, amaranth and Jerusalem\nartichoke.\n\n
      \       Richard St. Barbe Baker noted that even three to34our stones around
      a tree in the desert can\nmake the difference between survival and non-survival.\n\n\n
      \                                  ADDING WATER TO SOIL\n\n• Pitcher irrigation\n
      \       In many parts of the world,unglazed porous (low-fire) earthenware potsare
      buried in the\nsoil up to their necks and filled with water. Plants are placed
      around each pot. The technique can be\nused for trees as well as annual crops,
      one pot per tree.\n      An old Chinese bookfrom around100 B.C. suggested digging
      one pit for 200 sq ft, 28\ninches (71 cm) in diameter, 4 inches (10 cm) deep.
      Forty lb (18 kg) of manure was mixed with an\nequivalent amount of soil and
      added to the pit. A 6-qt (6-l) pot was buried up to the top in the center\nof
      the pit and filled with water, then covered with a tile. Four melon seeds were
      planted per pot, with\nonions or beans interplanted. 35\n      A more recent
      article fromIndia (1989) suggests 7- to 10-qt (7- to 10-liter) pots with\napproximately
      2 pots per 100 sq ft for creeping crops, i.e. bitter gourd, and approximately
      4 pots\nper 100 sq ft for upright/canopy crops. The most profitable crops were
      (in order): tomato, bottle\n\ngourd, bitter gourd, watermelon, and cauliflower.
      The technique was unprofitable for muskmelon.\n      Yields for melons in India
      were reported to be 25,000 kg per ha, the equivalent of 51 lb (23\nkg) per 100
      sq ft, with 0.74 inch (1.9 cm) of water (a beginning Biointensive yield)T   .
      his use of\nwater is 35 to 62 times more effective than in U.S. commercial agriculture.\n
      \     The survival of tree seedlings was 96.5% with pitchers, compared to 62%
      with hand watering,\nand the seedlings were 20% taller with pitchers.\n      The
      question may be asked as to whether one iswatering the plantsrather than thesoil
      with\nthis technique. Among the advantages: the pots deliver water directly
      to the root zone, therefore\nreducing evaporation losses; the rate of water
      loss can be controlled by what goes into the pot; and\nthe pots can be made
      with local materials and skills. Disadvantages include the high labor demand\nand
      the fact that the pores may clog over time.36\n      Ecology Action is currently
      (2011) testing some low-fire (1,700–2,000°F), porous (e.g. terra\ncotta) clay
      pots made in Ukiah, California, to grow tomatoes and tomatillos.\n      Pots
      are fragile; in Mexico and Kenya, high rates of breakage have been reported.
      In Kenya,\neight 20-litre pots per 200 sq ft were used to grow beans, which
      produced at the rate of 720 kg per\nacre (3.6 lb per 100 sq ft). Kenyans also
      use bottles with long necks filled with water and stuck into\nthe soil at an
      angle and supported.\n\n\n34\n35Richard St. Barbe Baker, citation pending.\n36David

      \     Here are somealternative suggestions for low-tech pitchersin the U.S.:\n•
      Use a plastic bottle. Cut a hole in the bottom, and put it upside down in the
      ground beside the\nplant. Fill it with a hose through the hole.\n• Use a square
      plastic water bottle with a faucet. Regulate the faucet to a slow drip. Make
      a hole in\nthe top, and fill with a hose.\n      Gourds could also be used.
      An Ecology Action intern from Israel suggested adding leaves\naround the pitchers
      to absorb and hold water in sandy soil.\n      At the Intensive Food Production
      on a Human Scale—Third International Conference on\nSmall-Scale and Intensive
      Food Production in Santa Barbara, California, October 26-29, 1981,\nJulian Gonsalves
      of the International Institute of Rural Reconstruction told the following story.
      A\nman in India had one acre (0.4 ha) of arid land where nothing would grow.
      He planted 14\npomegranate trees (drought-hardy) with water in pots for each
      tree. He kept water in the pots. After\n3 to 5 years when the trees were established,
      he added 14 more pomegranate trees with pots to the\nsame area. After another
      3 to 5 years, he added 14 more othertrees to the same acre and kept them\nwatered
      with pots. Eventually he reforested the entire area and brought back a thriving
      ecosystem\nand a living soil.\n\n\n• Drip irigation with a five-gallon bucket\n
      \       Some people in low rainfall areas are adopting a modified 5-gallon bucket
      that feeds water\ninto a drip irrigation system. It is important to ensure that
      this system is helping \"grow soil\". In\norder to do this, the soil should
      be watered—not just plants. In order to make this possible, the drip\nemitters
      need to be placed on 18-inch offset centers. The result will be \"pools of water\"
      that\noverlap—thus watering all the soil.\n\n\n                                  GLOBAL
      WATER SUPPLY\n\n        Many regions of the world on an Internal Renewable Water
      Supply basis (see following\npage) receive much less water than that necessary
      to grow food for their populations. One example\nis Egypt. The Nile River water
      comes from sources as far away as northern Kenya. As you can see\nin the following
      table, without the external water inputs, Egypt only has sufficient internally\ndeveloped
      water of about 73 sq ft per person to grow food! The increase in internally
      developed\nwater per person in Belgium probably has to do with a reduction in
      population.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                 2021
      \                                    CONCLUSION\n\n     All of the techniques
      described above will be more effective when comd ithGROW\nBIOINTENSIVE   concepts.\n\n
      \      Soon there will be extreme competition over increasingly scarce per capita
      water availability.\nUp to 80% of all the water used by people globally is used
      in agriculture. If more water-effective\nforms of food raising, suchGROW BIOINTENSIVE
      \ , are used, the amount of available water can be\nmore abundant—with sustainable
      soil fertility being built and maintained at the same time. Now is\nthe time
      to try some of the approaches described in this Booklet—at least in a small
      way. Why not\n\nbegin with a 50- to 100-sq-ft area as part of your garden, mini-farm
      or farm this year!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n

      \                                         PREFACE\n\nThank you for your interest
      in GROW BIOINTENSIVE   teacher and/or soil test station certification\nprogram.
      As we strive to recreate the cultural and biological foundations for \nthe resurgence
      of a human-\nscale agriculture, our success ultimately lies with those who decide
      not only to practice, but also to\n\nteach. Integral to our vision at Ecology
      Action is an ethic in which we as individuals and as members of\nhuman and ecological
      communities feel responsibility toward and take an active role in the stewar\ndship\nof
      soil, water, energy and genetic resources which make our lives possible. The
      cultural shift implied by\nthis ethic begins with the soil beneath our feet,
      as it is from such a rooted foundation of personal action\nthat our efforts
      can resonate outward to the world at large to address i\nssues related to resource
      equity,\nfood security, and ecological sustainability for all. Through the practice
      and promotion of human-scale,\nbiologically intensive food-raising, we work
      to preserve and enhance soi\nl fertility and revive and build\nupon a millennia-old
      base of knowledge.\n\n\nAs a gardener or mini-farmer, you have felt the personal
      satisfaction that stems from engaging in an\nintimate relationship with the
      cycles of life in your garden. Through theINTENSIVE   Teacher\nCertification
      process, we hope that you also gain satisfaction in that we are working together
      to create a\ncultural model of human sustainability and a more abundant future
      for us all.\n\nIn the description of this program, you will find all the information
      and materials needed to initiate and\npursue the certification process. VarGROW
      BIOINTENSIVE   teaching formats are described. Anyone\n\ncan teachGROW BIOINTENSIVE
      \  by using Ecology Action’s publications. Sometimes we find that people\nwant
      to modifyGROW BIOINTENSIVE   practices and/or teaGROW BIOINTENSIVE   practices
      in ways\nother than those described in this booklet. Either of these can be
      done\n, but neither meets the\nrequirements to be certified through this program.\n\nWe
      look forward to working with you. Do not hesitate to contact us if you have
      any questions.                                          INTRODUCTION\n\n\nAs
      population and land degradation increase, it becomes more and more difficult
      for the world’s people\nto grow enough food for themse®ves and their families
      and to develop and maintain sustainable soil\nfertilityGROW BIOINTENSIVE     Sustainable
      Mini-Farming offers hope as a low-input organic form of\nfood production with
      a capacity to build soil fertility.\n\nGROW BIOINTENSIVE     Sustainable Mini-Farming
      is not just an organic farming technique, but a system\nthat combines nutrition-based
      food production with closed-system soil fertility management,\nemphasizing reduced
      space.\n\n\nThe elements of GROW BIOINTENSIVE     Sustainable Mini-Farming include:\n
      \      • Deep soil preparation,\n       • Compost,\n       • Close plant spacing,\n
      \      • Companion planting,\n\n       • Carbon-farming (the growing of mature
      compost crops to produce sufficient compost for the\n           maintenance
      of sustainable soil fertility on a closed-system basis as well as a significant\n
      \          amount of calories),\n       • Calorie-farming (the growing of crops
      for calories on a small-scale basis with an emphasis on\n           special
      root crops which produce a large amount of calories per unit of area),\n       •
      Open-pollinated seeds (using and saving), and\n\n       • Treating all of the
      elements as parts of a whole system with a focus on long-term, ‘closed-\n           system’
      sustainable soil fertility.\n\nGROW BIOINTENSIVE     allows each of its practitioners
      to acquire the skills and dedication to\n take\nresponsibility to grow sufficient
      food with a fraction of the water, energy and purchased nutrients in the\nform
      of organic fertilizer required compared to chemical mechanized agriculture.GROW
      BIOINTENSIVE\nprovides the tools needed to grow food in a way that is truly
      sustainable: requiring no nonrenewable\n\nresources and capable of maintaining
      and improving soil fertility within a closed system.\n\nEcology Action's dream
      is to assist in soil regeneration by transforming veritable deserts into life-giving\ngardens
      and mini-farms. To achieve our vision, Ecology Action is dedicated to certifyingGROW\nBIOINTENSIVE
      \  teachers and soil test stations. Food production is not only a technic\nal
      skill and an art, it\nis a culture, and requires people to pass it on.\n\n\nIn
      2008, we began to work on updating our certification program with two key goals
      in mind: 1)\nSimplifying the process, 2) Creating certification standards for
      both teachers and soil test stations.\n\nThe certification program described
      is a result of this effort.\n\n\nPlease join us!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                   2

      DESCRIPTION\n\n\nGROW BIOINTENSIVE   teacher training equips the teacher not
      only with the practical knowled\nge and\nskills oGROW BIOINTENSIVE   Sustainable
      Mini-Farming, but also with the ability to teach oGROWs.\nBIOINTENSIVE  teachers
      combine lectures with demonstrations to illustrate key aspects of the method.\n\nPeople
      will understand the principlesGROW BIOINTENSIVE   mini-farming more readily
      if they can see\n\na well-designed, thriving mini-farm. The prospective certiGROW
      BIOINTENSIVE   teacher should set\nup a demonstration garden with contiguous
      beds, narrow paths, optimal orientation, space for compost\npiles (compost may
      be built on the growing beds), etc. A demonstration garden also ensures that
      the\ncertified teacher is continually learning from experience. Design aspects
      related to sustainability are\nillustrated in Appendix 13.\n\n\nThe Teacher
      Training and Certification Program strives to provide recognizable learning
      goals so that\nteachers can identify progress in the depth and quality of their
      learnin\ng and teaching.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n

      TEST STATION CERTIFICATION\n\nLike a certified teacher’s demonstration area,
      a Soil Test Station serves as a living model of GROW\nBIOINTENSIVE. However,
      a Soil Test Station must comply with more-rigorous record-keeping and\nresearch
      requirements. The goal of a Soil Test Station is to clearly demonstrate diet/compost
      designs and\nimplement a research plan. Unlike a demonstration site, which is
      not certified (the associated teacher is),\na Soil Test Stations isified.\n\nA
      Soil Test Station is envisioned to produce solid research in specific areas:
      soil fertility and\n\nnutrient cycling over time; use of plant-based composting
      materials necessary to\nmaintain/increase organic material and available nutrients
      in the soil; complete diets that provide\nsufficient calories and nutrients,
      and the minimum space to provide said diet; as well as income\ngeneration.\n\nThe
      goal is to measure progress over time toward sustainability and to modGROW\n\nBIOINTENSIVE
      \ as a closed system of diet/soil fertility within a reduced space.\n\nFor a
      site to be recognized as a Soil Test Station, Ecology Action requi\nres these
      basic criteria be\nmet:\n\n√ Minimum of 1000 sq ft in production using Mini-Farm
      design, ideally with the possibility of\n\n       expansion to 4000 sq ft\n√
      Sufficient infrastructure to accommodate Education/Training Plan (tools, garden
      area, etc.)\n√ Mini-Farm Design\n√ Planned Research\n\n√ Education/Training

      including crop failures\n           o Mini-Farm Design Report\n           o

      Quantity: Use for countable crops only, e.g. cucumbers, squash, etc.; not for
      beans, chard, etc.\n5We generally measure volumes in five-gallon buckets (5gB).
      Optional for Biomass Harvest.\n6The crop may produce two edible yields, as is
      the case for beets and beet greens, for example. Also, it may be useful to keep\n
      \ track of marketable, edible but unmarketable, and inedible yields. If you
      wish, you may use these spaces for such column\n  headings as may be relevant
      for a particular crop.\n\nBIOMASS\n\n        Biomass can include a crop grown
      for biomass (e.g. alfalfa, sorghum, fava beans) or residue from an\nedible crop
      (e.g. carrot tops, outside cabbage leaves, bean plants at the end of the season).
      We would prefer\nan air-dry weight for serious compost crops (e.g. alfalfa,
      sorghum, fava beans). This means thoroughly dried\nin a low-humidity environment,
      whenever possible.\n\nSteps\n\nIf the harvest is small,      1. Weigh crop at
      harvest.     2. Record harvest weight.\n        3. Allow crop to air-dry.     4.
      Weigh it again.    5. Record air-dry weight.\n\nIf the harvest is large,      1.
      Weigh crop at harvest.     2. Record total harvest weight.\n\n        3. Select
      a representative sample weighing at least two pounds (one kilo).\n        4.
      Record weight of sample. 5. Allow sample to air-dry.     6. Weigh sample again.\n\n
      \       7. Record air-dry weight of sample.\n        8. Divide air-dry weight
      of sample by original weight of sample (= % air-dry).\n\n        9. Multiply
      total harvest weight by % air-dry (= total air-dry weight)\n.\n        10. Record
      total air-dry weight.\n\n\n             PROCEDURE       [Convert all ounces
      in raw data to pounds (lb)EXAMPLE\n1. Harvest the crop. Weigh, and record the
      total harvest weight (H).                    H = 60 lb\n\n2. Take a representative
      sample of material that weighs at least two pounds. Weigh,     S = 2 lb\n        and
      record weight of sample (S).\n3. Let this material air-dry thoroughly.\n\n4.
      Weigh and record air-dry weight of sample (SD).                                      SD
      = 0.5 lb\n5. Calculate air-dry percentage (AD%): AD% = SD / S                                     AD%
      = 0.5 / 2 = 0.25\n\n6. Calculate air-dry weight of the total harvest (TADW):
      TADW= H x AD%                 60 lb x 0.25 = 15 lb\n\nYOUR NAME AND ADDRESS\n\n________________________________________________________________________\n___\n\n________________________________________________________________________\n___\n\nOBSERVATIONS:

      List annual teacher or site goals at beginning of year/growing season. Goals\n\nshould
      have indicators that are as “SMART” as possible (S             pecific, Measurable,
      Attainable,\nRealistic, Time-bound). Report results at the end of the year.
      Include supporting\n\ndocumentation, if pertinent.\n\nExample of Annual Site
      Goals to be submitted:\n\n1. Develop region-specific recommendations for open-pollinated
      seeds. Within the year, create\n\na list of varieties and sources of crops in
      diet design to be available by hard-copy or internet.\n\n2. Increase available
      tools for workshops and “lending library.” Purchase 15 new sets of forks\n                                                                                  th\nandstpades
      and garden tools. Write $1000 grant for purchase by May 15              . Obtain
      tools by July\n31 .\n\n3. Expand demonstration garden from 20 beds to 40 by
      August 31            s.\n\n\nExample of Annual Site Goal Report:\n\n1. Develop
      region-specific recommendations for open-pollinated seeds. Within the year,
      create\na list of varieties and sources of crops in diet design to be available
      by hard-copy or internet.\n\n\nFind attached list of varieties of open-pollinated
      seeds of the crops in the site’s diet design that\nhave been found in the area
      and their possible sources. Note that the list does not include a\n\nlocal source
      for tomatoes. We are remedying this by experimenting with a number of varieties\nand
      saving our own seed.\n\n2. Increase available tools for workshops and “lending
      library.” Purchase 15 new sets of forks\n                                                                                  th\nand
      spades and garden tools. Write $1000 grant for purchase by May 15 . Obtain tools
      by July\n31 s.\n\nWe had hoped to invest $1000 through a grant by a local foundation.
      The foundation approved\n                                                                                                      st\n$500,
      which we dedicated to buying 8 new sets of forks, etc. Tools were obtained by
      July 1 and\nhave been in use in lending library since August.\n\n                                                                          st\n3.
      Expand demonstration garden from 20 beds to 40 by August 31             .\n\nThe
      site currently has 30 beds in operation with 10 marked to be double-dug and
      sown with\ncompost crops in the next weeks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Teacher

      11: RESEARCH DESIGN AND REPORT GUIDELINES\n\n\n\n\nEach certified site is responsible
      for creating and executing specific research related tGROW\nBIOINTENSIVE   .
      The complexity of research will vary according to the goals and situation of
      each\nsite and should be established after consulting with Ecology Action. This
      research is above and\n\nbeyond the record-keeping (primarily yields) required
      for teacher certification. Research\nexamples: spacing, effects of interplanting,
      varieties, bed preparation, fertilizers, different\n\napplications of composted
      organic matter, etc.\n\nBasic Guidelines:\n\n1) Establish baseline data.\n\n2)
      Include a control whenever testing is done. Once baseline data is established,
      testing should\n\nbe done with reference to previous parameters. Only one variable
      should be tested in a given\ntest.\n\n3) Keep careful records on a standardized
      log sheet. Use the Ecology Action log sheet\npreferably.\n\n\n4) Repetitive
      tests (simultaneously or over the course of time) are key to measuring the validity\nof
      conclusions. Create cumulative reports of test repetitions.\n\n5) Draw possible
      conclusions based on test results. Describe conclusions in Annual Research\n\nReport.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n

      PREPARATION\n\nο   Manual double-digging (24 inches/60 cm deep), to establish
      or reestablish good soil structure.\n\nο   Surface cultivation (2 inches/5 cm
      deep) once good soil structure is established, to maximize\n      preservation
      of soil structure.\nο   Permanent growing beds a minimum of three feet (1 meter)
      wide, to ensure an optimal mini-climate.\n\n\nCOMPOST\n\nο   Regular use of
      cured compost in the GROW BIOINTENSIVE growing area, to maximize soil\n        water
      retention, soil structure building, and microbial diversity for soil health.\n\nο
      \  Non-use of green-manuring practices, to avoid depletion of significant amount
      of soil humus.\nο   Minimal use of composted animal manure (less than one-sixth
      by volume of organic matter inputs),\n      to avoid salt build-up and to minimize
      carbon lost through animal metabolism and curing process.\n\n\nFERTILIZER\n\nο
      \  Use of only organic fertilizers (on a one-time-only basis whenever possible).\n\n\nPLANT
      PROPAGATION AND SPACING\n\nο   Close GROW BIOINTENSIVE off-set spacing, to protect
      soil with a “livi\nng mulch” of plants.\nο   Use of flats or nursery beds for
      raising of seedlings and transplanting of seedlings into beds for most\n\n      crops,
      to minimize “in-bed” time, and water and seed used for each crop.\n\nPLANTING
      COMBINATIONS\n\n\nο   Crop rotations, to minimize “singular” nutrient depletion.\nο
      \  Companion planting, to encourage dynamic beneficial insect life.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n

                                           Our Soil, Our Future  

                               (Or: What You Are About To Do Is Important) 

                                                              

      You are about to embark on a journey.  


      While it will (we hope) be an interesting and enjoyable journey, it is not one without purpose. What you 
      are doing is important, and what you will learn over the next two weeks can make a great difference in 
      the way you live your life, the impact your life has on other people, and future of the world we all live in.  


      Before we begin, there are a few things you should know.  

      The main one is: Current farming models are not sustainable. The form of commercial agriculture 

      currently practiced in most of the U.S. and much of the world uses natural resources at rates greater 
      than they can be replaced. As a result, the world is facing a set of urgent challenges that are already 
      impacting food security, economic growth, and environmental and social stability around the globe.  


      These include: 

      • Food shortages. 870 million people in the world do not have enough to eat (UN‐WFP). UNESCO 

      predicts that, due to global population growth projections of 2–3 billion people over the next 40 years, 
      food demand will increase 70% by 2050. 

      • Water shortages. Water scarcity already affects every continent. It is estimated that by 2025 5.6 billion 

      people will experience conditions of water stress. As conventional agriculture accounts for ~70% ‐ 90% 
      of global freshwater withdrawals, food shortages will increase with water scarcity. And as water 

      becomes scarce, food will also become scarce. 

      • Loss of farmable soil. Across the globe, farms are losing the soil needed to grow food. According to the 
      IFAD, 12,000,000 hectares of agricultural land (topsoil) are lost and become virtual desert each year. It 

      takes 500 years to grow an inch of topsoil in nature; six inches (3,000 years’ worth) are needed to 
      successfully grow food.  


      Some estimates indicate that at current rate  of destruction, all remaining land will have effectively 
      become desertified in as little as 58 years. You can also make the case that in as little as 32 years, all 
      farmable soil will be gone.  


      Humus – known by soil scientists as soil organic matter (SOM) – is agriculture’s “canary in the coal 
      mine”.  Organic matter levels determine whether soil is fertile enough to produce food, to hold water, 

      nutrients and minerals where a plant’s roots can use them.   In 1972, when Ecology Action began its journey on a course of research to develop a truly sustainable 

      agricultural model for nutritious food production from the smallest area possible, SOM levels were 

      already low, averaging about 2% across the globe. Today, as a result of agricultural methods which 
      continuously withdraw organic     matter from the soil (in the form of crops and animals), SOM averages 

      about 1.2% worldwide.  

      Most sustainable soil research is focused on returning the SOM levels to the 2% range.  However, at 2% 

      SOM, the soil’s carbon‐sequestering, nutrient processing powerhouses – the microbes – are just waking 
      up.  Additionally, most agricultural soils are compacted and deoxygenated to the point that the 

      beneficial aerobic microbes can’t live. To further complicate matters, most soils are also demineralized, 
      lacking the calcium, magnesium, boron, sulfur, iron and other minerals in the necessary quantity and 

      balance to grow crops. And each time a     soil receives 7.5 inches of rain, the bioavailable minerals and 
      nutrients that are in the soil start to leach out of range of most plant roots.  


      All of these factors are making it increasingly difficult to get good yields, and to grow food with enough 
      nutrients to be worth eating.  


      Essentially, the soils that produce our food are 

      running on empty.  

      A healthy, productive, oxygenated soil that can 

      hold minerals and nutrients where the plants 
      can use them requires a minimum of 3% 

      organic matter in the tropics, and 4‐6% in 
      temperate regions. 


      In his book Edaphos: Dynamics of a     Natural 
      Soil System, author Paul Sachs says that it is 

      only possible to build up soil organic matter in 
      a stable way at a rate of 1/20  t of 1% (0.05%) 

      annually.  
       

      At this rate, with the current average SOM 

      levels at 1.2% globally, it will take 
      approximately 36 years to build up soils in 

      tropical regions to the point (3% SOM) that 
      they can hold water, nutrients and minerals. In 

      temperate zones, which require 4‐6% SOM,        
      the process will take approximately 56 years.  


      TO SUMMARIZE: Due to unsustainable agricultural methods, most soils have been depleted of organic 
      matter, and cannot hold minerals or nutrients in the root zone, which is causing decreased yields. As a 

      result, malnourishment increases, and over the course of the 36‐56 years it will take to build up the 
      required 3‐6% SOM, 5.6 billion people ‐ a majority of people on the planet – may well starve.               “No matter how far you have gone on a wrong road, turn back.” – Turkish Proverb 


                             So… at this point, you may be wondering: WHAT CAN WE DO?  


      The answer to that question is: we can do a lot.  
      To start with, we can begin heading in the right direction, right now. And that’s what this class is about.  

      But it may require you to change the way you think about some very basic things.  

      For example, fertilizer.  


      The world is in a situation of severe shortages of phosphorus, potassium and other nutrients vital to the 
      process of growing food. Ironically, because of this nutrient shortage, it would be a disaster if the world 

      suddenly converted to all organic production – there simply isn’t enough organic matter or nutrients to 
      support the standard organic production methods at a level necessary to feed the world.  

       
      This isn’t a new problem – the deserts of North Africa were once the Roman Empire’s granary, until the 

      soil gave out from over‐farming. There are people alive today who remember the Dustbowl era here in 
      the US. Traditionally, when soil stops producing, farmers have simply moved on to new land, or 

      extracted fertilizers from a  new vein of ore. But with 7 billion hungry mouths to feed, no new land to 

      farm, and no new frontiers opening up where we can safely and easily mine the nutrients we need, the 
      situation has become urgent.  


      Except that we are (almost literally) sitting on a bonanza of cheap, readily available minerals, and 
      bioavailable nutrients: human waste. 


      If growing food using Biologically Intensive farming methods, the waste products generated by one 
      person annually – properly, hygienically, safely, and legally processed into fertilizer – contain enough 

      nutrients to grow all the food for one person for one year. When you think about it, that means that if a 
      person lives for 85 years, eating and flushing away nutrients for each of those 85 years, they have 

      discarded a quantity of fertilizer sufficient to have fed 85 people (if they each recycle their waste 
      products properly) for their whole lifetime.   


      However, because of the situation we find ourselves in, in terms of organic matter levels, and 
      demineralization, we still have a situation of diminishing returns, with respect to yield and nutritional 

      value.  


      Imagine I’m someone living in Latin America, with soil organic matter at 1.2% and demineralization 
      causing decreased yields. Fortunately, I’m able to import nutrients on a one‐time basis to bring the soil 

      back up to productive levels. So, during the first year, I grow and eat my crops, and process my waste 
      into fertilizer. The garden receives at least 7.5 inches of rain, causing most of the surplus nutrients from 

      the imported fertilizer to leach too far into the soil for the roots of my crops to reach, and I can’t import 
      more nutrients because they’re expensive and scarce. However, I have my properly recycled human 

      waste, which came from food I grew in soil with sufficient nutrients, which     I use as fertilizer, replacing 
      the nutrients at acceptable levels for good production value. In year two, I grow and eat another crop, 

      and process the waste, and it rains another 7.5 inches. By year three, the cycle repeats, but this time, the 
      recycled waste can’t entirely replace the lost nutrients   because of leaching, and metabolism.  Partially offsetting this depletion is the fact that the R horizon in the soil (the bedrock) is slowly releasing 

      additional nutrients into the soil. In addition, deep‐rooting crops such as carrots, sorghum, maize, 

      comfrey, alfalfa and trees can work to bring up some of the nutrients leached out of the soil by rain.  

      But over time, as the leaching of nutrients increases, even with the use of recycled human waste, deep‐

      rooted plants and the slow decomposition of the R horizon, we will continue to have an increase in diet 
      and nutrient deficiency, with a corollary increase in disease and death. (But even death can contribute 

      something to the restoration of the world’s soils: recycling human bodies could provide a significant 
      source of balanced and bioavailable nutrients to add to the earth, a legacy that will help future 

      generations build a more sustainable and productive world.) 

      The fact of the matter is that until we bring the soil organic matter levels back up to the point that they 

      will hold water, nutrients and minerals – an estimated 36 years – we will be fighting a losing battle.  

      However, even if it will take time, it is a fact that we can build the soil, by adding the right amount of 

      aeration, the right quantity of minerals and the right amount of organic matter to the ground we work.   

      And Biointensive farming, when properly and methodically practiced as a whole system, can produce an 

      inch of fertile topsoil 60 times faster than nature, in as little as 8.5 years. Up to 6 inches with adequate 

      SOM levels can be grown in as little as 50 years.  

      The clock is running, and you’ve got 2 weeks to learn the basics. 


      So we’d better get started, right now.   

      Are you ready?

                                    PESTS AND DISEASES INFORMATION SHEET


                                                        Introduction


              Ecology Action receives many questions about pests and diseases and their control. In general, pests and
      diseases are nature's way of eliminating plants that are unhealthy so stronger pl ants can survive. Alan Chadwick,
      creator of the Bio-Dynamic/French Intensive method of gardening, and others have observed that diseases tend
      to attack healthier plants less. The real solution to healthy plants and fewer insect and disease problems is to

      build a healthy soil. A healthy soil nurtures healthy plants, and healthy plants provide good nutrition to nourish
      healthy people.

                                               Why Is My Plant Unhealthy?


      There are generally eight reasons why a plant is unhealthy:
              1) The plant is receiving too much o r too little sunlight.
              2) The plant is receiving too much or too little water.
              3) The plant is receiving too much or too little warmth.
              4) The soil was not properly prepared.

              5) The soil was not given sufficient compost.
              6) The plant's roots were damaged during transplanting.
              7) The minerals in the soil are deficient and/or unbalanced.
              8) The plants were transplanted too close to or too far from each other.
              9) Proper crop rotation and crop diversification are not being practiced.


                                                Some Symptoms and Causes

              Symptoms                               Causes
      - Leggy, weak, elongated stem          - Too little sunlight or transplanted too close together

      - Excessive wilting                    - Too much sunlight/warmth or too little water
      - Yellowish leaves                     - Too much or too little water
      - Stunted growth                       - Too little warmth, roots damaged during
                                                 transplanting, insufficient soil preparation, too
                                                 little compost added, soil minerals not balanced

                                                 and/or proper crop rotation and crop diversification
                                                 not being practiced
      - No mini-climate established          - Transplanted too far apart


                                                      What Can I Do?

              While the first three reasons may be obvious and easily corrected, the last six reasons are often
      overlooked and may be more difficult to remedy. Often, gardeners and farmers forget that, first and foremost, the
      soil must be given what it needs—air, water, compost and nutrients—in order to ensure healthy and vigorous

      plant growth.

              Some simple remedies for the first five reasons for pest and disease problems above are (listed in order
      corresponding to the reasons above):
              1) Increase the amount of sunlight the plant receives by removing any obstructions, or reduce the amount

                  of sunlight by adding shade -netting or a palm frond or twig "roof".
              2) Finger-test the soil, and decrease or increase the amount of water being used. Perhaps thetime of
                  watering needs to be earlier or later.

                          © 1994, 2006 Ecology Action, 5798 Ridgewood Rd., Willits, CA 95490-9730. p. 1        3) Add shade-netting or a heat-capturing row cover. Plant the crop in the proper season next year.
              4) Gently cultivate around the plant as deep as possible without disrupting the roots. Double -dig the soil

                  before planting the next crop.
              5) Add cured compost (that is 50% soil by volume) at the rate of 2 to 4 cubic feet (3 to 6 five -gallon
                  buckets) per 100 square feet of soil (1/4 - to 1/2-inch layer). Gently incorporate the compost into the
                  soil to the depth of2 to 4 inches with a spading fork.


              Solutions to the last four reasons for unhealthy plant growth and subsequent pest and disease problems
      are (listed in order corresponding to the reasons above):
              6) Be careful next season to handle the roots of the plant s you are transplanting as little as possible. The
                  root should be straight down into the soil and not hooked (J -rooted).

              7) Have your soil analyzed by a reputable soil analyst. One excellent soil analyst is Timberleaf Soil
                  Testing, 39648 Old Spring Road, Murrieta 92563-5566; (951) 677-7510;
                  tmbrlfsoiltest@murrieta.net. Add the recommended compost, organic fertilizers and amendments
                  before planting next year. For best long -term results, have your soil tested annually for at least five
                  years.

              8) Transplant the plants next year on the spacing recommended in How to Grow More Vegetables by
                  John Jeavons (Berkeley, CA: Ten Speed Press, 2002), pp. 88      -116, or change the spacing you are
                  currently using on an experimental basis to determine what works best for your climate (in most
                  cases, the spacing in How to Grow More Vegetables will give excellent results).
              9) Avoid planting any crop in the same place that that crop or a crop in the same family was

                  harvested from the previous year. Diversify the crops grown on your farm as much as possible.

                                                         Other Remedies


              Other remedies for pest infestations are described below. Pests generally have two of the following four
      characteristics. They are: 1) hard-bodied; or 2) soft-bodied; and 3) chewing or biting; or 4) sucking. Their    body
      type and the way they eat can determine the way they most easily can be dealt with. Chewing or biting, soft- or
      hard-bodied insects can be easily managed with aromatic and distasteful sprays such as garlic, onion and pepper
      sprays. Sucking, soft-bodied insects can be easily controlled with soap solutions (not detergent). Hard-bodied,

      sucking insects are slightly more difficult to control and should be hand  -picked.
              In the tropics, insect management is more challenging. See references 1 and 2 on page 5 for more
      information.
              When using controls, there are some things to be aware of:
              1) Identify the insects in your garden, and learn about their life cycles. Often, there is a "weak link" in the

                  life cycle of an insect, a point at which the life cycle can be easily interrupted. Knowing when and
                  how the life cycle of the insect can be interrupted may allow you to easily and effectively keep insect
                  populations in balance.
              2) Insects are not pests until they reach intolerable numbers. The point in managing pes ts is to get their
                  populations to reasonable numbers, not to eliminate them. Some harmful insects are needed to be a

                  food supply for beneficial insects, in order for a balance to be sustained.
              3) It often takes several weeks for the beneficial insect popul ations to catch up with the number of pests.
                  Patience and a watchful eye can be the very best control measures, especially during the early spring.
              4) While botanical sprays are safe to use, they can kill off the predator population as well as the pests.
                  They should be used as a last resort.

              5) Simply removing infested parts of plants is often the best control for disease.
              6) Crop rotation, diversification and cultivation are very important in preventing many insects from
                  becoming "pests".
              If you have insect and disease problems you need to address while you are building up the health of your
      soil, you may want to use the specific remedies described in the "Safe and Sane Pest Control Chart" below

      and/or the references listed on page 5.

             To use the following chart, find the host plant in the alphabetical listing. The letters after the plant's name
      correspond to the letters in the pest list. These are the various pests which might be found on this plant. The
      numbers following the name of the pest refer to the method of control for that particular insect, listed on page 4.
      It is important to note that certain life -stages, e.g. larval, can bebeneficial predators. Try to use the least toxic
      approach possible, to preserve the most balance and life in your mini -ecosystem. Before acting, be sure to learn

      as much as you can about each crop and problem, using one or more of the resources listed in the Bibliography.

      1. Bacillus popilliae: disease specific only to Japanese beetle grubs.
      2. Bacillus thuringiensis: disease of moth and butterfly larvae. Effective, safe, very selective.
      3. Cultivation (includes clean-up of debris): upsets life cycles of insects which hatch or pupate in soil.

      4. Handpicking (including eggs): very effective and safe. (Wear gloves for blister beetles.)
      5. Homemade Botanicals: various mixtures of pepper, garlic, etc. Contact insecticides. For example:
            Blend 3 hot peppers, 3 large onions, and 1 garlic bulb and add water to make 1 gallon.
      6. Nicotine*: contact insecticide made from tobacco. Can be highly toxic, but little or no residue. Easily

            washed off. A homemade tobacco spray can be made by packing stems or cut up plug tobacco in a
            container and pouring boiling water over them, enough to cover. Let this stand for several hours.
            As the water cools, the special qualities of the tobacco are extracted. Pour off the brown liquid and
            dilute with 1 part of tobacco brew extract to 4 parts water. Use only in extreme cases. Toxic to
            beneficials. Do not use on eggplant, peppers, potatoes or tomatoes to avoid conta mination with

            tobacco mosaic virus. Do not use within one month of harvest.
      7. Oil Sprays: suffocate pests. Mineral or vegetable oils can be used on foliage; heavier
            miscible oils without additives on dormant fruit trees. Dormant: 1 part 10 wt oil to 15 parts water.
            Foliage: 3 parts 10 wt oil to 100 parts water.
      8. Pheromone Traps: combination of synthesized sex attractants and poison in cardboard

            traps which are hung in trees. (Codling Moth, Redbanded Leafroller, Oriental Fruit Moth, and
            several maggot flies.)
      9. Protective Collars: cups, cans, etc., open at both ends, placed around seedlings.
      10. Pyrethrum*: dried, ground flowers of Oriental chrysanthemum. Contact and stomach
            poison. Gives quick kill or paralysis. Widely used in household spray s. Pyrethrum spray: 1

            teaspoon to 1 tablespoon of fresh pyrethrum powder, 2 quarts to 1 gallon of hot water. Add a little
            soft soap and let the mixture stand for awhile before using. Should be sprayed as a fine mist.
            Pyrethrum can also be used as a powder.
      11. Quassia*: wood chips of Jamaican tree. Quassia spray: soak 2 ounces of quassia chips in 1 gallon of
            water for 2 to 3 days. Simmer for 2 or 3 hours. Add 2 ounces soft soap (liquified or boiled solution

            of ordinary soap in water which becomes a jelly, which may then be further diluted to the desired
            consistency). Contact insecticide.
      12. Rotenone*: derris and cubé powder from roots containing rotenone. Contact and stomach poison.
      13. Row cover, e.g. Reemay: disrupts life cycle by preventing air-borne insects from laying eggs in soil.
      14. Ryania*: from stems and leaves of South American plant. Contact insecticide.

      15. Sabadilla*: ground seed of Venezuelan plant of lily family. Used since 1600's. Contact and stomach
            poison. Toxicity increases with age.
      16. Soap spray: Palmolive Green, or other biodegradable soap, at 1 tablespoon soap to 1 gallon water.
            Creates film which kills some insects. Used as wetting agent with many insecticides.

      17. Tanglefoot or Stickem: spread thin, even layer on piece of stiff yellow paper and hang it up to trap
            flying insects. A 3-inch band around tree trunks will control ants.
      18. Water: strong spray on leaves.
      19. Wood Ash: spread lightly around base of plants to discourage soil pests. Keep ashes off the plant
            itself. Caution: high in magnesium. Not recommended for soils not deficient in magnesium.


      * Only to be used as a last resort, because these are broad -spectrum organic pesticides which kill
            beneficial insects as well as harmful ones. Wear protective clothing when ha ndling, and check
            labels carefully for residual characteristics.
      Note: Please read one of the Resources marked with a # for cautions.

                           This article was written by Philip Northcraft, a Ph.D. in Entomology,
                    after he attended Ecology Action's Special Seven -Day Teachers Workshop in 1995.



              From July 15 to 21, 1995, I observed the insect life at the Willits Research Garden. Good insect life
      existed, and also an abundance of balanced insect life. There did not appear to be an overabundance of pest

      insects to cause damage. Why?

              There was a diverse population of beneficial insects that were feeding on aphids, nectar, pollen
      sources and water. Lacewing eggs, parasitic wasps, mummified aphids, ladybeetle adults and larvae, hover
      flies and ground beetles were observed in adequate numbers to maintain pests below levels that would

      damage the crops. Bees and other pollinators were also noted doing an e xcellent job and therefore giving an
      additional boost to the crops' production.

              What practices at Willits have led to these good natural biological conditions in the garden? Since no
      pesticides are used, no selection pressure exists. Without selection pr essure to produce resistant insects and

      without broad-spectrum chemicals killing the beneficial insects, the naturally occurring beneficials are left in
      a reasonably balanced micro-niche competing for enough foods among a small population of "pest insects" .
      Interestingly, there was an adequate amount of pests (food) for the good bug population not to over -indulge
      in by increasing their population too rapidly and then collapsing when the pests (food) were annihilated.


              It should also be noted that no drip i rrigation is used, which can act as a superhighway for ants. Ants
      "tend" aphids and feed on their sugar-rich byproducts. These byproducts help maintain and increase ant
      populations. Ants will farm and protect aphids against beneficial insects. Ants are abl e to quickly transport
      themselves along the drip lines back and forth from their nests and food source very effectively while
      increasing the vitality of their nests.


              Another cultural practice that may assist in low insect populations is the acceptance of a 3- to 5-
      percent crop loss. This eliminates the spraying of unnecessary chemicals that disrupt a biologically
      controlled balance. The plant material of the lost crop may be composted and its nutrients recycled.


              Finally, hand watering at dusk providesan ideal time to observe insect life. Insects tend to become
      active as the day cools and the breeze becomes minimal. This time can provide a good opportunity to collect,
      identify and document why the garden is so successful in avoiding major insect damageduring the growing
      season.

                                        ROOTS IN THE SOIL

                                            Information Sheet


      Question:      I was wondering why root organic matter is more effective per pound of roots
            than normal compost in the soil?

      Answer:        I do not know that roots are more effective at enhancing soil fertility than compost
            by weight, but they are more effective than other types of organic matter (e.g. leaves,
            stems, seeds) per dry weight equivalent. The only comparison you can make is that root

            matter left in the soil is more effective than a similar amount of organic matter composted
            and added to the soil. You see, compost has already lost most of its water and is in a
            concentrated state. This has been shown to be true in a number of controlled experiments.

            It is only speculation, but roots are perfectly incorporated into the soil and their breakdown
            probably creates more effective channels of gas, water, and microbial exchange than most

            tillage practices. Also, roots are not like leaves and stems; roots and soil have no clear
            distinct boundaries. Roots secrete substances into the soil and actually feed soil life and
            transform the soil chemistry in a zone around themselves. This area, called the rhizosphere,
            is full of hormones, enzymes, microbial life, and "biological substances" which are
            probably more effective than simple "soil food" (i.e. carbon, nitrogen, calcium, etc.). These
            root-created substances act more dynamically and expand the potential soil fertility. It is

            not really understood, and amazingly little is known about root/soil interaction.

            Roots, once thought to be mere anchors for the plant or absorptive organs, are now
            understood to be vital organs in the production of metabolic chemicals essential for the
            basics of plant life.

            As an end note: roots contain more dry matter than other parts of the plant; roots account

            for approximately 30 to 40% of the total plant's weight (dry) for most vegetables.

                  ABOUT     GROW BIOINTENSIVE                 ® TERMINOLOGY


      For the purposes of the educational materials and presentations on the Curriculum Resources and

      Self-Teaching Tools pages of Ecology Action’s website www.growbiointensive.org, it is useful
      to have alternative terms to use when discussing biologically intensive practices that may differ
      from the officially certified GROW BIOINTENSIVE processes developed by Ecology Action.


      For this reason, we have designated the following terms to describe the inclusion of different
      techniques and practices within the context of biologically intensive farming and gardening:

          •  The term “biointensive” (not capitalized) should be used in non-EA situations.

          •  The term “Biointensive” (capitalized) may be used to describe “Group 1: Biointensive Mini-
             Farmer/Farm” and “Group 2: Transitional Biointensive Sustainable Mini-Farmer/Farm”
             activities.

          •  And the term “GROW BIOINTENSIVE” or “GB” is used only when referencing “Group 3:
             Full GROW BIOINTENSIVE Sustainable Mini-Farmer/Farm” activities.


      Complete descriptions of these designations and what they entail can be found below.

      In order to distinguish Ecology Action’s biologically intensive sustainable mini-farming
      processes, developed over more than four decades, from the practices of other organizations

      using the term (Bio-Intensive Integrated Pest Management, for example), Ecology Action has
      decided to use the nameGROW BIOINTENSIVE   . In effecGROW BIOINTENSIVE   is the "brand

      name" of Ecology Action's publications and educational services and is also used for the
      certifying of seeds and produce complying withGROW BIOINTENSIVE   guidelines. This term,
      always in capital letters, can be used for the system as a whole, the component parts of the

                   What defines a GROW BIOINTENSIVESustainable Mini-Farm?

      GROW BIOINTENSIVE    Sustainable Mini-Farming is not just an organic farming technique, but a

      system that combines nutrition-based food production with closed-system soil fertility
      management, emphasizing reduced space.

      The elements of GROW BIOINTENSIVE    Sustainable Mini-Farming include:
          • Deep soil preparation

          • Compost
          • Close plant spacing
          • Companion planting

          • Carbon-farming (the growing of mature compost crops to produce sufficient compost for
           the maintenance of sustainable soil fertility on a closed-system basis as well as a significant
           amount of calories)
          • Calorie-farming (the growing of crops for calories on a small-scale basis with an emphasis

           on special root crops which produce a large amount of calories per unit of area)
          • Open-pollinated seeds (using and saving), and
          • Treating all of the elements as parts of a whole system with a focus on long-term, ‘closed-

           system’ sustainable soil fertility.

      In order to ensure closed-system sustainable soil fertility, the GROW BIOINTENSIVE mini-

      farm allocates approximately 60% of its growing space to carbon/calorie crops, approximately
      30% to special root crops for efficient calorie production, and approximately 10% to vegetable
      crops and possible income crops.

      GROW BIOINTENSIVE    allows each of its practitioners to acquire the skills and dedication to take

      responsibility to grow sufficient food with a fraction of the water, energy and purchased nutrients
      in the form of organic fertilizer required, compared to chemical mechanized agricultuGROW
      BIOINTENSIVE  provides the tools needed to grow food in a way that is truly sustainable: requiring

      closed system.

                              What are the different levels of achievement

                a Biointensive or GROW BIOINTENSIVEFarmer or Farm can attain?

      To be a Biointensive or GROW BIOINTENSIVE Sustainable Mini-Farmer or Mini-Farm, the
      garden, mini-farm or farm of an individual, project, program or organization must be using the
      following practices. These practices are grouped in three levels of increasing involvement:

          1. “BIOINTENSIVE MINI-FARMER”

          2. “TRANSITIONAL BIOINTENSIVE SUSTAINABLE MINI-FARMER”, and
          3. “FULL  GROW BIOINTENSIVE            SUSTAINABLE MINI-FARMER”.


                    GROUP 1: CRITERIA FOR “BIOINTENSIVE MINI-FARMER”

          SOIL PREPARATION
             •   Manual double-digging (24 inches/60 cm deep), to establish or reestablish good soil
                 structure.
             •   Surface cultivation (2 inches/5 cm deep) once good soil structure is established, to

                 maximize preservation of soil structure.
             •   Permanent growing beds a minimum of three feet (1 meter) wide, to ensure an optimal
                 mini-climate.

          COMPOST
             •   Regular use of cured compost in the Biointensive growing area, to maximize soil water

                 retention, soil structure building, and microbial diversity for soil health.
             •   Non-use of green-manuring practices, to avoid depletion of a significant amount of soil
                 humus.
             •   Minimal use of composted animal manure (less than one-sixth by volume of organic

                 matter inputs), to avoid salt build-up and to minimize carbon lost through animal
                 metabolism and the curing process.

          FERTILIZER
             •   Use of only organic fertilizers (on a one-time-only basis whenever possible).

          PLANT PROPAGATION AND SPACING
             •   Close Biointensive off-set spacing, to protect soil with a “living mulch” of plants.

             •   Use of flats or nursery beds for raising of seedlings and transplanting of seedlings into
                 beds for most crops, to minimize “in-bed” time, and water and seed used for each crop.

          PLANTING COMBINATIONS
             •   Crop rotations, to minimize “singular” nutrient depletion.
             •   Companion planting, to encourage dynamic beneficial insect life.

          SEEDS

             •   Use of open-pollinated seeds, to preserve plant genetic diversity and mini-farm
                 sustainability.




                               © 2014 Ecology ActionRevised 8/9/14 p. 3 of 5    •  Non-use of hybrid, green-revolution and/or genetically engineered seeds, because of their

             general incapacity to reproduce true to type and for their narrowing of the global
             agricultural germplasm base.

      WHOLE SYSTEM
          •   Growing of compost crops, for closed-system sustainability.
          •   Growing of calorie crops (i.e., root and grain crops).


                 GROUP 2: CRITERIA FOR “TRANSITIONAL BIOINTENSIVE
                                SUSTAINABLE MINI-FARMER”
                         (Prerequisites: “Biointensive Mini-Farmer” Criteria)


      SUSTAINABLE SOIL FERTILITY AND DIET CALORIES (30%-65% of the GROW
      BIOINTENSIVE area)
          •   Growing 30%-65% of the Biointensive area in carbon crops high in carbonaceous

              material to be used for composting (e.g. wheat, maize/corn, oats, barley, amaranth,
              cereal rye, quinoa, sorghum or local equivalents). These crops should also produce
              significant amounts of calories for the human diet.

      ENSURING A COMPLETE DIET IN A SMALL AREA (15%-50% of the GROW

      BIOINTENSIVE area)
          •   Growing 15%-50% of the Biointensive area in special root calorie crops for the
              production of large amounts of calories for the human diet (e.g. potatoes, sweet potatoes,
              garlic and parsnips or local equivalents). A small proportion of this area can be in crops
              with a medium level of caloric “area efficiency,” such as onions, turnips and leeks.


      VEGETABLES AND/OR INCOME
          •   Growing not more than 20% of the Biointensive area in vegetable crops normally used
              in salads, salsas and sauces (e.g. tomatoes, carrots, cucumbers and lettuce), for balancing

              dietary vitamins and minerals, and/or income crops to minimize export of soil nutrients.


                 GROUP 3: CRITERIA FOR “FULL        GROW BIOINTENSIVE
                                SUSTAINABLE MINI-FARMER”

                          (Prerequisites: “Biointensive Mini-Farmer” plus
                    “Transitional Biointensive Sustainable Mini-Farmer” Criteria)

      SUSTAINABLE SOIL FERTILITY AND DIET CALORIES (Approx. 60% of the GROW
      BIOINTENSIVE area)
          •   Growing 50%-70% of the  GROW BIOINTENSIVE   area in carbon crops high in
              carbonaceous material to be used for composting (e.g. wheat, maize/corn, oats, barley,

              amaranth, cereal rye, quinoa, sorghum or local equivalents). These crops should also
              produce significant amounts of calories for the human diet.

      ENSURING A COMPLETE DIET IN A SMALL AREA (Approx. 30% of the GROW
      BIOINTENSIVE area)
          •   Growing 20%-40% of the  GROW BIOINTENSIVE   area in special root calorie crops for

              the production of large amounts of calories for the human diet (e.g. potatoes, sweet
              potatoes, garlic and parsnips or local equivalents). A small proportion of this area can be

              •   Growing not more than 10% of the   GROW BIOINTENSIVE     area in vegetable crops
                  normally used in salads, salsas and sauces (e.g. tomatoes, carrots, cucumbers and
                  lettuce), for balancing out dietary vitamins and minerals, and/or income crops to
                  minimize export of soil nutrients.


          OVERALL NATURAL SYSTEM SUSTAINABILITY
              •   Leaving 50-75% of the farm property wild (protected, if necessary), to ensure ecosystem
                  plant and animal diversity and water replenishment.

                                                      A /58-inch-thick plywood board, 2 to 3 feet long by 3 to 5 feet
                                                  wide, serves as a “digging board” to stand on. The size of the board

                                                  will depend on your height and the width of the bed. Treat the board

                                                  with linseed oil to protect it against soil moisture. This board will
                                                  distribute your weight over the bed as you dig or work on the bed.

                                                      A bow rake (preferably 5 feet 6 inches in length) makes leveling
                                                  and forming the bed easy. A hula hoe is the perfect tool for cultivat-

                                                  ing the upper 2 to 4 inches of soil.





                                                  Laying Out Your Beds


                                                  Carefully choose a place for your raised beds that has access to water

                                                  and sunlight—preferably b7 to 11 hours of direct sunlight each day.
                                                      To begin, mark out a bed 3 to 5 feet wide and at least 3 feet

                                                  long. A 3 foot by 3 foot space assures a minimum mini-climate. Most
                                                  people prefer beds to be 5, 10 or 20 feet long, as it makes calculat-

                                                  ing easier.
                                                      The maximum length should be determined by ease of work.

                                                      Consider your source of compost. Ideally, you will have com-
                                                  post that you have prepared available as you begin to prepare your

                                                  beds. However, many decide to purchase compost or aged manure
                                                  to begin. For this initial application of organic matter, one may

                                                  consider aged manure. While compost is preferable, if one chooses

                                                  aged manure, assure that it is two-year-old steer or cow manure, or
                                                  two-year-old horse manure that originally contained a lot of saw-

                                                  dust, or two-month-old horse or chicken manure not containing
                                                  much sawdust.

                                                      The best time to double-dig the soil is in early morning or eve-
                                                  ning in spring or autumn. The air temperature is cooler at these

                                                  times so less soil organic matter is lost in the process. Dig only
                                                  when the soil is evenly moist. It is easier and also better for the

                                                  soil. Digging a hard, dry soil breaks down the structure, and it
                                                  is difficult to penetrate. Wet soil is heavy and easily compacted.

                                                  Compaction destroys friable structure and minimizes aeration.

                                                  These conditions kill microbiotic life. Correct soil moisture can be
                                                  determined by a simple hand test. Soil is too dry for digging when

                                                  it is loose and will not hold its shape after being squeezed in the
                                                  palm of your hand (in cases of sands or loams) or when it can-

                                                  not be penetrated by a spade (in the case of clays). Soil is too wet
                                                  when it sticks to the spade as you dig.

                                         AND MAINTENANCE









                   reparing the raised bed is an important step in GROW BIO-
                   INTENSIVE gardening. A correctly prepared bed facilitates
              P    proper soil structure. Propersoil structure and nutrients
               allow uninterrupted and healthy plant growth. Loose soil with good
               nutrients enables roots to penetrate the soil easily, and a steady
               stream of nutrients can flow into the stem and leaves. How dif-
               ferent from a situation in which a plant is transferred from a flat
               with loose soil and proper nutrients into a hastily prepared back-
               yard plot or a chemically stimulated field. The plant suffers not
               only from the shock of being uprooted, but also from an environ-
               ment where it is difficult to grow. The growth is interrupted and
               the roots have difficulty getting through the soil and obtaining
               food. As a result, the plant produces more carbohydrates and less
               protein than usual. This imbalance attracts insects. A debilitating

               cycle can begin that ends in the use of pesticides which kill soil life
               and make the plants even less healthy. Fertilizers are then used
               in an attempt to boost the plants’ health. Instead, the fertilizers
               destroy more soil life, damage the soil structure further, and lead to
               even less healthy plants that attract more insects and “need” more
               toxic “medicines” in the form of additional pesticides and fertilizers.

                                                      A /58-inch-thick plywood board, 2 to 3 feet long by 3 to 5 feet
                                                  wide, serves as a “digging board” to stand on. The size of the board

                                                  will depend on your height and the width of the bed. Treat the board

                                                  with linseed oil to protect it against soil moisture. This board will
                                                  distribute your weight over the bed as you dig or work on the bed.

                                                      A bow rake (preferably 5 feet 6 inches in length) makes leveling

                                                  Laying Out Your Beds


                                                  Carefully choose a place for your raised beds that has access to water

                                                  and sunlight—preferably b7 to 11 hours of direct sunlight each day.
                                                      To begin, mark out a bed 3 to 5 feet wide and at least 3 feet

                                                  long. A 3 foot by 3 foot space assures a minimum mini-climate. Most
                                                  people prefer beds to be 5, 10 or 20 feet long, as it makes calculat-

                                                  ing easier.
                                                      The maximum length should be determined by ease of work.

                                                      Consider your source of compost. Ideally, you will have com-
                                                  post that you have prepared available as you begin to prepare your

                                                  beds. However, many decide to purchase compost or aged manure
                                                  to begin. For this initial application of organic matter, one may

                                                  consider aged manure. While compost is preferable, if one chooses

                                                  aged manure, assure that it is two-year-old steer or cow manure, or
                                                  two-year-old horse manure that originally contained a lot of saw-

                                                  dust, or two-month-old horse or chicken manure not containing
                                                  much sawdust.

                                                      The best time to double-dig the soil is in early morning or eve-
                                                  ning in spring or autumn. The air temperature is cooler at these

                                                  times so less soil organic matter is lost in the process. Dig only
                                                  when the soil is evenly moist. It is easier and also better for the

                                                  soil. Digging a hard, dry soil breaks down the structure, and it
                                                  is difficult to penetrate. Wet soil is heavy and easily compacted.

                                                  Compaction destroys friable structure and minimizes aeration.

                                                  These conditions kill microbiotic life. Correct soil moisture can be
                                                  determined by a simple hand test. Soil is too dry for digging when

                                                  it is loose and will not hold its shape after being squeezed in the
                                                  palm of your hand (in cases of sands or loams) or when it can-

                                                  not be penetrated by a spade (in the case of clays). Soil is too wet
                                                  when it sticks to the spade as you dig.

                         The goal of double-digging is to loosen the soil to a depth of                                                    Soil Creation

                    24 inches below the surface. The first year, you may only be able to

                    reach 15 to 18 inches with reasonable effort. Be satisfied with this
                    result. Do not injure yourself or your tools. More important than

                    reaching 24 inches in the first years is improvement over the course
                    of time. Nature, the loosened soil, worms, and plant roots will

                    further loosen the soil with each crop, so digging will be easier each

                    year and the depth will increase over time. Be patient in this soil-
                    building process. It takes 5 to 10 years to build up a good soil (and

                    one’s skills). Actually, this is very rapid. Nature usually requires a

                    period of 3,000 years or more to build the 6-inch layer of farmable
                    soil needed to grow a good crop of food.

                         After the soil has been initially prepared, you will find that the
                    GROW BIOINTENSIVE method requires less work per unit of food

                    produced than the gardening technique you presently use. The Irish

                    call this the “lazy bed” method of raising food.





                    Types of Deep Soil Pjreparation


                    The double-dig is the principal way one prepares a GROW BIOIN-

                    TENSIVE bed until good structure is established. Afterwards, one

                    will depend on surface cultivating the top 2 to 4 inches. Another
                    way to keep soil loose between double-digging is to single-dig (loos-               Proper soil structure and nutrients

                                                     General Double-Digging Procedure—

                                                     Each year before the main crop until

                                                     good soil structure is established



                                                     Spread a layer of compost over the entire area to be dug. After

                                                     marking the bed, place the digging board on the bed, leaving
                                                     approximately 24 inches from the end of the bed for the first trench.

                                                     Remove 7 five-gallon buckets of soil from the upper level of the first
                                                     trench (assuming a 5-foot-wide growing bed; see illustration on

                                                     page 25). Be sure to dig trenches across the width of the bed. This

                                                     will give you 3 buckets of soil to make compost (these will eventu-

                                                     1 bucket of soil to make flat soil to grow seedlings, and the remain-

                     a spading fork, a few inches at a time if the soil is heavy or tight.
                     Leave the fork as deep as it has penetrated, and loosen the subsoil

                     by pushing the fork handle down and levering the tines through the

                     soil. If the soil is not loose enough for this process, lift the chunk of
                     soil out of the trench on the fork tines. Then throw it slightly and

                     gently upward, and allow it to fall back on the tines so it will break

                     apart some. If this does not work, use the points of the fork tines to
                     break the soil apart. Work from one end of the trench to the other

                     in this manner.
                          Next, move back the digging board (approximately the 12-inch

                     width of the next trench). Dig another trench behind the first one,

                     moving each spadeful of the top 12 inches of soil forward into the
                     first trench. When digging, make as few motions and use as little

                                                   and involve less work. In fact, as you dig the soil, you will dis-

                                                   cover you can use an Aikido-like economy of motion and energy

                                                   in which you are virtually just shifting your balance and weight
                                                   rather than digging. Sometimes you will have to work over a

                                                   trench a second or third time to remove all the soil and obtain the
                                                   proper trench size. Repeat the subsoil loosening process in the

                                                   second trench.
                                                       Dig a third trench, and so on, until the entire bed has been

                                                   double-dug. It helps to level the soil with a rake every 3 to
                                                   4 trenches during the digging process. If you do not, you may end

                                                   up with a very deep trench at the end of the bed. Then you will
                                                   have to move a large amount of soil from one end of the bed to

                                                   the other to even it out when you are ready to be finished. This

                                                   action also causes a disproportionate misplacing of topsoil into
                                                   the subsoil area.

                                                       When you are sliding the soil forward from one trench into
                                                   another, notice a couple of things. If you spread compost on the bed

                                                   before beginning, note that some of the layer slides 3 to 6 inches
                                                   down into the trench, creating a small mound of soil or landslide.

                                                   This approximates the way nature adds leaves, flower bodies, and
                                                   other decaying vegetation to the top of the soil, where they break

                                                   down and their essences percolate in the soil.
                                                       Always make sure that the upper layer of soil (the top

                                                   12 inches) is not turned over during the double-dig. Most of the

                                                   microbiotic life lives in the upper 6 inches of the soil. Also, the
                                                   natural layering of the soil that is caused by rainfall and leaching,

                                                   soil is loosened up and distributed somewhat. Aim for a balance
                                                   between nature’s natural stratification and the loosened landslid-

                                                   ing soil. (As a goal, strive not to mix the soil layers. Even though
                                                   some mixing will occur, it is important to avoid excessive disrup-

                                                   tion of the soil layers.)
                                                       When you are through double-digging, the aerated surplus soil

                                                   in the bed will be enough to fill the final trench at the end of the

                                                   bed. You may also add some of the buckets from the first trench. If
                                                   you add compost that you have made with soil, that will also con-

                                                   tribute soil to the bed.

                                                       Level and shape the bed. Sprinkle on compost and any soil
                                                   amendments as recommended by your soil test over the surface of

                    Considerations for Initial Dig

                    with Very Poor Soils


                    You may choose to add compost at different points for the initial

                    double-dig and when working with a soil with very low amounts of
                    organic matter. Instead of applying compost onlyafter the double-
                                                1
                    dig, consider spreading a    2-inch layer over the bedbefore double-
                    digging and/or a  1/2-inch layer during the dig by incorporating it

                    thoroughly into the 12-inch-deep trench.



                    BED PREPARATION PER 100 SqUARE FEET

                     1. Check the soil moisture. The soil should be evenly moist to facil-
                        itate digging, but not saturated. If needed, water the area to

                        be dug. For hard, dry clays that have not ever been cultivated,

                        this may mean up to 2 hours with a sprinkler. Begin next steps
                        when soil is evenly moistened.


                     2. Loosen 12 inches of soil with a spading fork, and remove any

                        plant cover.


                     3. Check soil moisture and water again if necessary. If your soil
                        has particularly large clods, consider waiting several days and

                        let nature help do the work. The warm sun, cool nights, wind,
                        and water will help break down the clods. Water the bed lightly

                        every day to aid the process.

                            OPTIONAL (ONE TIME): At this time, sand may be added
                        to a bed with a clayey soil, or clay to a bed with sandy soil,

                        to improve texture. Normally you should add no more than
                        1/2inch (4 cubic feet) of sand or clay. (More sand may allow

                        water-soluble fertilizers to percolate down too rapidly.) Mix the
                        sand or clay thoroughly into the loosened 12 inches of soil with

                        a spading fork.

                                                            OPTIONAL (ONE TIME): If the soil is poor (very sandy or
                                                                                                               1
                                                        very clayey), add on a one-time-only basis up to a      2-inch layer
                                                        (8 cubic feet) of compost or aged manure.

                                                            Remove the soil from the upper part of the first trench and
                                                        place it in a soil storage area for use in making compost and flat

                                                        soil or to return to the last trench.


                                                     4. Loosen the soil an additional 12 inches.

                                                            OPTIONAL (ONE TIME): Spread a           1/2-inch layer of compost
                                                        on the loosened soil of the first trench.



                                                     5. Dig out the upper part of the second trench and move it forward
                                                        into the first upper trench.


                                                     6. Loosen the lower part of the second trench.


                                                     7. Continue the double-digging process (repeating steps 7 and 8)

                                                        for the remaining trenches. Rake every 3 to 4 trenches to ensure

                                                        even bed height.


                                                     8. Fill inthe final trench. Shape the bed by raking it. Evenly
                                                        spread compost and any needed fertilizers over the entire area.

                                                        Sift in compost and any fertilizers 2 to 4 inches deep with a

                                                        spading fork. Your bed is ready to be transplanted!


                                                    TYPES OF DEEP SOIL PREPARATION


                                                    Simplified Side Views
                                                    Ecology Action uses 4 basic types of deep soil preparation processes:

                                                     • the basic ongoing double-dig, shown on page 26


                                                     • the complete texturizing double-dig, shown on page 27


                                                     • the U-bar dig, shown on page 28


                                                        The complete texturizing double-dig was developed to

                                                    usually in place of the initial double-dig, but it can be used at a later

                                                    point in time. We have found this soil preparation process greatly

                     and heavy soil. It is often worth the extra digging time involved.

                     However, it does use an insustainable amount of organic matter.
                          The U-bar dig can be used as a substitute for the ongoing

                     double-dig in soil that is in reasonably good shape. This usually

                     means after one normal double-dig or more. The 18-inch-long U-bar
                     tines (see page 28) do not prepare the soil as deeply as a spade and

                     a spading fork used to double-dig 24 inches deep, but the lower

                     12 inches of the growing bed compact more slowly over time than
                     the upper 12 inches. Also, the U-bar appears to have the advantage

                     of mixing up the soil strata much less than double-digging with a

                     spade and a spading fork. It aerates the soil less, however. This is
                     an advantage in looser, sandier soil and can be a problem in tighter

                     clays. If you use a U-bar regularly, do a normal double-dig as often

               76–78). The soil frIom the next trench’s upper level may then be moved forward onto them. This is theI easiest way we have found to plant po-
               tatoes. (Mark the location of the potatoes with stones or sticks in Ithe outside paths before covering them with soIil. This will indicIate where
               potatoes should be placed on the surface of each succeeding lower trench.)

                                                            Remember that applying compost from outside the garden is
                                                        unsustainable. The amounts needed for applying multiple layers

                                                        of compost are not typically able to be produced in a garden. There-

                                                        fore, Ecology Action recommends applying compost before and/or

                                                        application. As you get higher yields, you may even be able to “pay-

                                            731/2"      back” the borrowed compost to its original source.

                                                            Compost applications will help very sandy or clayey soils to
                                                        have better structure. However, sometimes food-growers decide

                                                        to add sand or clay to improve the texture. Ecology Action recom-

                    Prepared Beds                                                                                                       Soil Creation


                    Whenever you reprepare a bed (after each crop or season) until

                    good structure is created, the 24-inch depth of the bed should be

                    measured from the bed, not from the path surface. Ecology Action
                    reprepares the soil between crops with a double- or single-dig (loos-

                    ening the first 12 inches of soil with the fork). As your soil improves
                    and the large clods disappear, your bed may not raise as high as                    path    bfed

                    initially. Do not worry about this. It is a sign that you and your soil
                                                                                                      soil in the path is sufbject to
                    are successful. The goal of double-digging is not the height of the               compaction; soil in tfhe bed
                    bed, but a reasonable looseness and good structure of the soil.                   remains loose .

                        Once good structure has been established by double-
                    digging, it is preferable to use surface cultivation (the

                    loosening of the upper two inches of soil with a cultivating

                    tool such as a hula hoe) for several years, or more. In this
                    way, the developed structure and soil organic matter are better

                    preserved.
                        One simple way to determine whether our soil has good struc-

                    ture follows. Squeeze a sample of reasonably moist soil firmly in

                    your hand. Then open your hand. If the soil falls apart easily, it does
                    not have good structure. If it holds the shape of your hand even

                    when you press it gently with the fingers of your other hand, it does
                    not have good structure. If the soil breaks apart into small clumps

                    when you press it with your fingers, it probably has good structure.

                        When surface cultivation is used,compost made with-                           the loosened soil of the fplanting

                    bed during the soil preparation process. Whenever the lower soil
                    becomes compacted, the bed may be double-dug again to encourage

                    reestablishment of a well-aerated structure.

                        Remember that structure is different from texture. Thetexture
                    is determined by its basic ingredients: silt, clay, and sand particles.

                    The soil structure is the way these ingredients hold together. With
                    your assistance, sticky “threads” exuded by microbial life and the

                    roots produced by the plants help to loosen a clay soil and improve a             the GRow BiointEnsiVE raised

                    Once the bed is prepared, you will truly appreciate its width. The

                    distance between the tips of your fingers and your nose is about

                    3 feet when your arm is extended out to the side. Thus a 3- to
                    5-foot-wide bed can be fertilized, planted, weeded, and harvested

                    from each side with relative ease, and insects can be controlled
                    without walking on the bed. A 3- to 5-foot width also allows a good

                     by stakes, such as tomatoes, pole beans, and pole peas, for easier

                     harvesting.

                         Try not to step on the growing beds once they have been pre-
                     pared. To do so compacts the soil and makes it more difficult for the

                     plants to grow. If the bed must be walked on, use the double-digging
                     board. This will displace your weight over a large area and mini-

                     mize the damage. Plants obtain much of their water and nutrients

                     through the contact of their root hairs with the soil. If they do not
                     develop an abundant supply of root hairs, less water and fewer

                     nutrients are taken in. The root hairs are more numerous and vig-
                     orous in looser soil, so keep your soil loose.

                     between young plants before the mini-climate takes effect, you
                     should cultivate.

                         Once this beautifully alive bed is prepared, it should be kept
                     evenly moist until and after planting so the microbiotic life and

                     plants will stay alive. The bed should be planted as soon as pos-

                     sible so the plants can take advantage of the new surge of life made
                     possible by bringing together the soil, compost, air, water, sun, and

                     fertilizers.
                         A good growing bed will often be 2 to 10 inches higher than the

                     soil’s original surface. A good soil contains 50% air space. (In fact,

                     adequate air is one of the missing ingredients in most soil prepara-
                     tion processes.) Increased air space allows for increased diffusion

                     of oxygen (which the roots and microbes depend on) into the soil,
                     and of carbon dioxide (which the leaves depend on) out of the soil.

                     The increased “breathing” ability of a double-dug bed is a key to

                     improved plant health. Thus, the prepared depth will be as much as
                     34 inches in clayey soil. A sandy soil will probably not raise as high

                     as clayey soil at first. To prevent erosion and promote more even
                     water saturation in a clay bed with a high rise, create a lip around

                     the top of the bed (see page 73).

                         If the bed raises higher than 10 inches as you are double-
                     digging, be sure to level it out with a rake as you go along. Other-

                     wise you will end up with a very wide and deep trench at the end
                     of the bed. Then you will have to move a large amount of soil from

                                                      This would also cause a disproportionate misplacing of topsoil into

                                                      We currently re-prepare the soil after each crop, except for autumn

                                                      compost crops. Some people prefer to do this only once each year.
                                                      As your soil improves and the large clods disappear, your bed may

                                                      not raise as high as initially. Do not worry about this. It is just a

                                                      is not the height of the bed, but the looseness and good structure of

                   how to Design for Your Soil’s Fertility


                   In order to more easily sustain the fertility of your soil and decrease
                   the space necessary to produce a large percentage or your entire

                   diet in the smallest area, Ecology Action recommends that you:
                                                                                                                                  Sustainability

                     • Maintain approximately60% of your growing area in carbon-
                       and-calorie crops that produce large amounts of carbon for

                       compost and that also produce food in the form of significant

                       amounts of calories. Legumes can also be interplanted to pro-
                       duce immature biomass and fix nitrogen in the soil if they are

                       harvested at 50% flower.


                     • Grow approximately 30% in special root diet crops that produce
                       large amounts of calories in limited space per unit of time.


                     • Have a maximum of 10% in vegetable crops for additional vita-

                       planted in income crops if the missing needed vitamins and

                       minerals are provided by one-quarter of the area.)


                       See the information on the following pages for details. We hope
                   that these guidelines will make your path to sustainability easier.

                   Remember that the goal is to grow sufficient compost material in
                   your growing space in order to maintain levels of organic matter as

                   well as cycle nutrients. Annual soil tests provide you with the infor -
                   mation to monitor your success and direction.

                      In order to mini-farm sustainably, take these goals into account

                 as you grow compost crops and apply compost.

                    notes: Application of 1 cu ft/100f sq ft is not sufficifent to prevent minerals from leaching out because the soil will lfikely lack sufficient orfganic matter (unless the organic
                 matters were originally high) .
                    compos t production will likely increase as a system operates over time and the gardener becomes more adept and experienced and soil conditions improve
                    Ecology Action’s research shows that very few systems on the average will be able to produce more than 4 cu ft/100 fsq ft sustaina .bAlysustainable mini-farm will apply the

                                        reborn. Both animals and plants die on forest floors and in mead-

                                     air to produce a soil improved in structure and nutrients. Organic
                                     plant growing follows nature’s example. Leaves, grass, weeds, prun-
                                     ings, spiders, birds, trees, and plants should be returned to the soil
                                     and reused—not thrown away. Composting is an important way to
                                     recycle such elements as carbon, nitrogen, magnesium, sulfur, cal-

                                     cium, phosphorus, potash, and trace minerals. These elements are all
                                     necessary to maintain the biological cycles of life that exist naturally.
                                     All too often we participate instead in agricultural strip-mining.

                                       Composting in nature occurs in at least 3 ways:

                                                  Compost Functions


                                                  Compost has a dual function. It improves thestructure of the soil.
                                                  This means the soil will be easier to work, will have good aeration

                                                  and water-retention characteristics, and will be resistant to erosion.
                                                  Compost also providesnutrients for plant growth, and its organic
                                                  acids make nutrients in the soil more available to plants. Fewer

                                                  nutrients leach out in a soil with adequate organic matter.
                                                      Improved structure and nourishment produce a healthy soil. A

                                                  healthy soil produces healthy plants better able to resist insect
                                                  and disease attacks. Most insects look for sick plants to eat. The

                                                  best way to control insects and diseases in plants is with a living,
                                                  healthy soil rather than with poisons that kill beneficial soil life.

                                                      Compost keeps soil at maximum health with a minimum
                                                  expense. Generally, it is unnecessary to buy fertilizers to be able to

                                                  grow healthy plants. At first, organic fertilizers may have to be pur -
                                                  chased so the soil can be brought to a satisfactory level of fertility in

                                                  a short period of time. Once this has been done, the soil’s health can
                                                  be maintained with compost, good crop rotation, and the recycling

                                                  of plant residues into the compost pile.
                                                      It is important to note the difference betweenfertilization and

                                                  fertility. There can be plenty of fertilizer in the soil, and plants still
                                                  may not grow well. Add compost to the soil, and the organic acids it

                                                  contains will release the hidden nutrients in a form available to the
                                                  plants. This was the source of the amazing fertility of Alan Chad-

                                                  The Process



                                                  Compost is created from the decomposition and recombination of
                                                  various forms of plant and animal life, such as leaves, grass, wood,

                                                  garbage, natural-fiber clothes, hair, and bones. These materials
                                                  are organic matter. Organic matter is only a small fraction of the

                                                  total material that makes up the soil—generally between 1% and
                                                  8% by weight. Yet organic matter is absolutely essential to the sus-

                                                  tenance of soil life and fertility. Organic matter refers to dead plant
                                                  and animal residues ofall kinds and in all stages of breakdown or

                                                  decay. Inseparable from these decaying dead residues are the living
                                                  microorganisms that decompose, or digest, them.

                                                      Microscopic life-forms (bacteria and fungi) in the soil produce
                                                  the recombining process, which creates the warmth in the compost

                    pile. Most of the decomposition involves the formation of carbon
                    dioxide and water as the organic material is broken down. You can

                    monitor the temperature of your compost pile with a compost ther       -

                    mometer. You can also do this by inserting a 1 by 1-inch piece of
                    wood into the pile, removing it periodically and feeling the warmth

                    with your hand. You can judge whether the latest measurement is
                    hotter or cooler than before.

                        As the available energy is consumed, microbial activity slows
                    down, their numbers diminish—and the pile cools. Most of the

                    remaining organic matter is in the form ofhumus compounds.
                    Humus includes the living and dead bodies of microbial life. As
                                                                                                                                      Compost
                    humus is formed, nitrogen becomes part of its structure. This stabi-
                    lizes nitrogen in the soil because the humus compounds are resis-

                    tant to decomposition. They are worked on slowly by soil organisms,

                    but the nitrogen and other essential nutrients are protected from
                    too-rapid solubility and dissipation. Organic matter includes humus

                    and some undecomposed organic matter.
                        Humus also acts as a site of nutrient adsorption (accumulation

                    of nutrients on its surface) and exchange for plants in the soil. The
                    surfaces of humus particles carry a negative electric charge. Many

                    of the plant nutrients—such as calcium, sodium, magnesium, potas-
                    sium, and most trace minerals—carry a positive electrical charge

                    in the soil solution and are thereby attracted to and adhere to the
                    surface of humus. Some of the plant nutrients—such as phospho-

                    rus, sulfur, and the form of nitrogen that is available to plants—are

                    not positively charged. Fortunately, a good supply of these nutrients
                    becomes available to the plants through biological transformation

                    in the compost pile and soil.
                        As plant roots grow through the soil in search of nutrients,

                    they feed on the humus. Each plant root is surrounded by a halo of
                    hydrogen ions that are a by-product of the roots’ respiration. These

                    ions also carry a positive electric charge. The root actually “bar -
                    gains” with the humus, exchanging some of its positively charged

                    hydrogen ions for positively charged nutrient ions stuck onto the
                    surface of the humus. An active exchange is set up between humus

                    and roots, the plants “choosing” which nutrients they need to

                    balance their own inner chemistry.
                        Therefore, humus is the most reliable plant food, and plants

                    pull off whatever combinations of nutrients they choose from its
                    surface. G ROW BIOINTENSIVE practices rely on this natural,

                    continual, slow-releasing biological process for nutrient release to
                    the plants, rather than making available all the season’s nutrients

                    chemically at one time.

                                                        The beauty of humus is that it feeds plants with nutrients that

                                                    the plants pick up on its surface and it also safely stores nutrients
                                                    in forms that are not readily leached. The humus contains much of

                                                    the remainder of the original nitrogen that was put in the compost

                                                    formed by the resynthesizing activity of numerous species of micro-
                                                    organisms feeding off that original “garbage.”

                                                        The microorganisms in the soil then continue to feed on the

                                                    humus after the finished compost is spread on the soil. As the
                                                    microorganisms feed, the core nutrients in the humus are released

                     Locating the Pile



                     Compost piles can be built in a pit in the ground or in a pile above

                     the ground. The latter is preferable, since during rainy periods a
                     pit can fill up with water. A pile can be made with or without a con-

                     tainer. We build our compost piles without using containers. They
                     are unnecessary and use wood and metal resources.

                         The pile should optimally be built under a deciduous oak tree.

                     This tree’s nature provides the conditions for the development
                     of excellent soil underneath it. And compost is a kind of soil. The

                                                      by the trees help keep the pile at an even moisture level. (The pile

                                                      should be placed 6 feet away from the tree’s trunk so it will not

                                                        is recommended. (In colder climates, a minimum compost pile size

                                                        of 4 feet by 4 feet by 4 feet will be needed to properly insulate the

                                                       The best time to prepare compost is in the spring or autumn,

                                                   and even kills the microbial life in the pile.) The two high-activity

                                                   and in the autumn, as leaves fall and other plant life begins to die.

                                                   Compost built at other times will simply cure more slowly.

                                                       bind the soil particles together. The fungi, with theirthreadlike
                                                       mycelia, are especially important. They literally sew the soil

                                                       together. The microbes secrete compounds into the soil as they
                                                       live, metabolize, and ultimately decompose. Their secretions are

                                                       a bacterial glue (polysaccharides) that holds soil particles, thus
                                                       improving the soil’s structure. Structure is vital to soil produc-

                                                       tivity because it ensures good aeration, good drainage, good

                    Building the Pile


                    The ground underneath the pile should be loosened to a depth of

                    12 inches to provide good drainage. Next, lay down roughage (brush,
                    tree prunings, cardoon stalks, or other woody materials) 3 inches

                    thick, if available, for air circulation.
                        One recipe for GROW BIOINTENSIVE compost is,by volume,

                    45% mature (dry) material, 45% immature (green) vegetation (includ-
                    ing kitchen wastes), and10% soil. Each layer should be watered

                    well as it is created. This 45/45/10 recipe will give you a carbon-to-
                    nitrogen ratio in your built compost pile of about 30 to 1, and will
                                                                                                                                       Compost
                    produce compost with a significant amount of high-quality, short-
                    term humified carbon. The result will be a hotter (thermophilic

                    113° to 149°F) pile with faster-releasing cured compost that gener     -

                    ally releases nutrients over a 3-month to 2-year period. A lot of the
                    carbon in this type of compost pile is lost, however, and the result-

                    ing cured compost only contains about one-third to one-half the
                    cured organic matter that a cooler (mesophilic 50° to 113°F) 60-to-1

                    compost pile will produce.
                        A 60-to-1 pile is built with approximately 8 parts mature

                    material to 2 parts green vegetation (including kitchen wastes) and
                    1 part soil. The result of this pile will be a slower-releasing cured

                    compost that generally releases nutrients over a 3-month period
                    (and up to 5,000 years!) especially if the mature materials contain

                    a large amount of lignin, such as corn and sorghum stalks. This

                    can be a way to build up your soil fertility on a long-term basis, but
                    the more readily available nutrients in the cured compost from a

                    30-to-1 pile will be important for the good growth of most vegeta-
                    bles. We make separate compost piles of small tree branches, since

                    they can take 2 years or more to decompose.
                        The materials should optimally be added to the pile in 1- to

                    2-inch layers with the mature vegetation on the bottom, the imma-
                    ture vegetation and kitchen wastes second, and the soil third (in a

                    1/4- to 2-inch layer). You can, however, build a pile spontaneously,
                    adding materials daily or so, as they become available. This kind of

                    pile will usually take a little longer to cure, but can be built more

                    easily. Mature vegetation is high in carbon content. It is difficult for
                    the microbes in the compost pile to digest carbon without sufficient

                    amounts of nitrogen.
                        Unless you have a large household, it may be necessary to save

                    your kitchen scraps in a tight-lidded unbreakable container for sev-
                    eral days to get enough material for the kitchen waste layer. You

                                                  within a few hours after reintroducing air. All kitchen scraps may

                                                  when waste from members of the cabbage family is added. In a few

                                                  days, however, even this soil-minimized odor will disappear.





                                                  Watering the Pile


                                                  As each layer is added, water it thoroughly so the pile isevenly
                                                  moist—like a wrung-out damp sponge that does not give out excess

                                                  water when squeezed. Sufficient water is necessary for the mate-
                                                  rials to heat and decompose properly. Too little water results in

                                                  decreased biological activity, and too much simply drowns the aero-
                                                  bic microbial life. Water the pile, when necessary, as you water your

                                                  garden. The particles in the pile should glisten. During the rainy
                                                  season, some shelter or covering may be needed to prevent water      -

                                                  Usually, a compost pile needs one turning to adjust the moisture
                                                  level and make the mixture more homogeneous for complete break-

                                                  down. This should be done at about the 3-week point, after the

                                                  temperature of the compost pile has peaked and fallen. A decrease

                     The GROW BIOINTENSIVE method of making compost differs in

                                                   no rock powder fertilizers or nitrogen supplements. Fertilizers
                                                   do not need to be added to the pile since successful compost can be

                                                   made from a mixture of ingredients. The nitrogen supplements do,

                                                   however, speed up the decomposition process. Both the biodynamic
                                                   and Rodale methods are good ones, proven by use over a long period

                                                   of time. Chadwick’s Biointensive recipe seems simpler to use and
                                                   equally effective.

                                                       Some people use thesheet composting, a process of spread-
                                                   ing uncomposted organic materials over the soil and then digging

                                                   them into the soil, where they decompose. The disadvantage of this
                                                   method is that the soil should not be planted for 3 months or so,

                                                   until decomposition has occurred. Soil bacteria tie up the nitrogen
                                                   during the decomposition process, thereby making it unavailable to

                                                   the plants. Sheet composting may be beneficial if it is used during

                                                   the winter in cold areas because the tie-up prevents the nitrogen
                                                   from leaching out during winter rains.

                                                       Other people use green manures—cover crops such as vetch,
                                                   clover, alfalfa, beans, peas, or other legumes, grown until the plants

                                                   are at 10% to 50% flower. The nitrogen-rich plants are then dug
                                                   into the soil. By using these legumes in this manner, a maximum of

                                                   nitrogen is fixed in their root nodules. (The nitrogen is taken from
                                                   the nodules in the seed-formation process. You can tell whether the

                                                   nodules have fixed nitrogen by cutting one in half with a finger    -
                                                   nail. If the inside is pink, they have fixed nitrogen.) This is a way

                                                   to bring unworked soil into a better condition. These plants pro-

                                                   vide nitrogen without your having to purchase fertilizer, and they
                                                   also help you dig. Their roots loosen the soil and eventually turn

                                                   into humus beneath the earth. Fava beans are exceptionally good
                                                   for green manuring if you plan to plant tomatoes; their decomposed

                                                   bodies help eradicate tomato wilt organisms from the soil.
                                                       However, we find that green-manure crops are much more effec-

                                                   tive when used as compost materials, and their roots still have their
                                                   good effect in the soil. There are several reasons for this. Due to

                                                   their high nitrogen content, green manures decompose rapidly and
                                                   even deplete some of the soil’s humus. Another disadvantage of the

                                                   green manuring process is that the land is not producing food crops

                                                   during the period of cover crop growth and the 1-month period of
                                                   decomposition. Additionally, green manures generally produce only

                                                   about one-quarter the carbon in a given area that carbonaceous
                                                   compost crops do, and carbon in the form ofhumus is the most lim-

                         The advantage of the small-scale GROW BIOINTENSIVE

                     method is that backyard composting is easily feasible. When you

                     use compost crops without digging in the crop residues, the growing
                     process will put nitrogen into the soil and make it possible to grow

                     plants, such as corn and tomatoes which are heavy nitrogen feed-
                     ers. And the plant residues are valuable in the compost pile.

                     If you need to use manures and/or less desirable materials in your

                     compost pile, they should make up only one-sixth of your pile by
                     volume so their less optimum effects will be minimized. Some mate-

                                                  binds together sandy soil. It helps make proper aeration in clayey

                                                  Moisture retention—Compost holds 6 times its own weight in

                                                  water. A soil with good organic matter content soaks up rain like a
                                                  sponge and regulates the supply to plants. A soil stripped of organic

                                                  matter resists water penetration, thus leading to crusting, erosion,
                                                  and flooding.


                                                  Aeration—Plants can obtain 96% of the nutrients they need from

                                                  the air, sun, and water. A loose, healthy soil assists in diffusing air
                                                  and moisture into the soil and in exchanging nutrients. Carbon

                                                  dioxide released by organic matter decomposition diffuses out of the

                                                  soil and is absorbed by the canopy of leaves above in a raised bed
                                                  mini-climate created by closely spaced plants.


                                                  Fertilization—Compost contains some nitrogen, phosphorus, potas-

                                                  sium, magnesium, and sulfur, but is especially important for trace
                                                  elements. The important principle is to return to the soil, by the use

                                                  of plant residues and manures, all that has been taken out of it.


                                                  Nitrogen storage—The compost pile is a storehouse for nitrogen.
                                                  Because it is tied up in the compost-breakdown process, water-soluble

                                                  nitrogen does not leach out or oxidize into the air for a period of 3 to
                                                  6 months or more—depending on how the pile is built and maintained.


                                                  pH buffer—A good percentage of compost in the soil allows plants

                                                  to grow better in less-than-optimal pH situations.

                    Soil toxin neutralizer—Important recent studies show that

                    plants grown in organically composted soils take up less lead, heavy

                    metals, and other urban pollutants.


                    Nutrient release—Organic acids dissolve soil minerals and make
                    them available to plants. As organic matter decomposes, it releases

                    nutrients for plant uptake and for the soil microbial population.


                    Food for microbial life—Good compost creates healthy conditions

                    for organisms that live in the soil. Compost harbors earthworms

                    and beneficial fungi that fight nematodes and other soil pests.                                                       Compost


                    Ultimate in recycling—The Earth provides us with food, clothing,
                    and shelter, and we close the cycle in offering fertility, health, and

                    life through the shepherding of materials.





                    Building a Compost Pile Step-by-Step



                      1. Under the pile area (9 or 16 square feet),loosen the soil, to
                        12 inches deep with a spading fork.



                      2. Lay down roughage, such as brushor other woody material,                      note: we sometimes build a
                        3 inches thick, if it is available, for air circulation.                       compost pile on an unused growing

                                                                                                       bed will pick up andf utilize any

                                                                                                       into the soil . the next season we

                        weeds, grass clippings, hedge trimmings, green cover crops, and
                        kitchen wastes you have saved. Water well.


                      5. Cover lightly with a     14- to /2-inch layer of soil to prevent

                        flies and odors.


                      6. Moisten the soil.


                      7. Add new layers of mature vegetation,immature vegetation,

                        kitchen waste, and soil as materials become available until the

                                                      8. Cover the top of the pilewith a /   1 2- to 1-inch layer ofsoil.


                                                      9. Water the completed pileregularly until it is ready for use.



                                                    10. Let the completed pile cure 3 to 6 months while you are
                                                        building a new pile. Turn the pile once for faster decomposition.

                                                        For planning purposes, remember that a 4-foot-high compost
                                                        pile will be 1 to 11/3 feet high when it is ready to use.

                                                        You can try this by using:


                                                        • slightly more carbonaceous material and/or less nitrogenous

                                                           material,


                                                        • more coarse materials and less fine ones,


                                                        • slightly more soil when building the pile,


                                                        • slightly more water when building the pile,and



                                                        • a “no turn” approach.


                                                        The first time we did this, wegot 38% more cured compost. One
                                                        publication implies that up to 100% more may be possible.

                         (immature leaves and stalks). The result may be more durable,
                         lasting cured compost.



                      5. Maintaining the curing compost piles, carefully            . A cured
                         compost pile that has been properly maintained can contain

                         20% or more organic matter rather than the more typical

                         8% to 10%. All cured compost is not equal. One cubic foot of
                         cured compost may have double or more the compost power!

                             In a world with increasingly depleted and desertified soils,

                         sufficient amounts of compost will be key.

                           PRINCIPLE 3: INTENSIVE PLANTING 

                                             Goal: Create enhanced and
                                        uninterrupted root and plant growth

        T   he third leg of the stool is intensive planting. It creates enhanced and uninterrupted plant and root

        growth by transplanting seedlings in a close, off-set spacing pattern so theirffi leaves are barely touching at ma-
        turity, creating a living mulch over the soil!

        The living mulchresults in a mini-climate between the plants and the soil, retaining moisture and protecting
        soil from wind and water exposure that can lead to erosion. Intensive planting also maximizes root material,
        which increases the biological activity and the organic matter in the soil. (When the soil is healthy, roots can
        be healthy; when roots are healthy, plants can be healthy.)

        Intensive planting limits weed growth, supporting the plants and saving labor. Additionally, the farmer
        benefits because the hexagonal pattern maximizes the number of plants in a given area, increasing yield.


        From above, the pattern looks like this:
                                                     Each plant is the same distance from all the plants around
                                                     it. In the center is the seedling and the circle around it is the
                                                     area the plant covers when it is full-grown. From the side,
                                                     the leaves should look like this:








                                              GB Farmer’s Challenge:

        Experiment with the best spacing for your climate. For example, try lettuce 8, 10, 12, and 14 in (20, 25, 30, 35
         cm) apart and measure your yields per unit of area to compare production, soil coverage, and plant health. Re-
                        member to try experiments 3 or more times to be confident in the conclusions!

        Intensive planting is also utilized in the process of growing your own seedlings for transplanting. This farm-
        ing practice contributes to the sustainability of the farm through supporting a closed system (not buying
        seedlings). Seedlings can be grown in flats, in any container that drains well and is deep enough for roots
        (at least 3 in/ 7.5 cm), or in a nursery bed. Propagate seedlings in a way that allows them enough room to
        grow, while creating a good mini-climate over the flat, container or bed. Use the off-set spacing pattern, put-
        ting most seeds on 1 or 2 in (2.5 or 5 cm) spacing. If the seeds are too small to handle, scatter them evenly.

        To have enough space for the seedlings to develop properly, it may be necessary to move these seedlings to
        another flat, container or area on off-set spacing once they have germinated. This process is called “pricking
        out.” Most seedlings are pricked out on 1.5 or 2 in (3 or 5 cm) spacing.

                     HINT:                   Your plants will be healthiest if you transplant the seedlings when their

                                                that will be ready to plant when the weather allows, and

              moisture imbalance.            creating good soil moisture instead of focusing on the plants.



      Using intensive planting, along with compost and deep soil preparation, is the foundation for a sustainable
      farm. These principles work together to create and support a healthy, vibrant soil, which can produce higher
      yields. A key in sustainable farming is to recognize that soil is the foundation of life! Farmers grow food that
      nurtures life; therefore, farmers must grow and honor the soil.


      These first three principles of GROW BIOINTENSIVE take care of the soil; they are the three legs that are
      the solid foundation of a good stool. To strengthen the system and complete the stool, the GB farmer em-
      ploys five more principles.

                                                 GB Farmer’s Challenge:

       Continue reading and implement these ideas on your farm. Watch carefully to see the patterns that are consistent
              between beds, crops, and seasons. Learn from these patterns and remember that things take time.

                        Seeds should be planted at a depth equal to their thickness. Lima

                    and fava beans may be planted on their sides. Their root systems,
                    which emerge from an eye, can grow straight down. The seeds

                    should be covered with humus-containing flat soil, which is similar

                    to the soil with decomposed plant matter found over germinating
                    seeds in nature. The compost stimulates the germination process.

                        Seeds, whether they are planted in beds or in flats, should be

                    in chapter 8 to see how far apart to space different types of plants.

                    The leaves of seedlings in the flat and of plants in the growing
                    bed should barely touch. Appropriately spaced plants form a liv-

                    ing mulch, which retards weed growth, aids in the retention of soil

                    moisture by shading the soil, and creates the mini-climate under

                    the seedling at its transplanting stage. In general, the plant spac-

                    ings listed in the Master Charts for vegetables, flowers, and herbs

                    are equal to the “within the row” spacings listed on the back of seed
                    packets, or sometimes three-quarters of this distance. Disregard

                    any “between row” spacings. The Master Charts list our best spac-
                    ing determinations to date for these plants.

                        To make the placement of seeds in planting beds or flats eas-
                    ier, use frames with 1-inch or 2-inch mesh chicken wire stretched

                    across them. The mesh is built on a hexagonal pattern, so the seeds
                    can be dropped in the center of a hexagon and be on the proper cen-

                    ter. Or, if a center greater than 1 inch is involved and you only have

                    1-inch mesh, just count past the proper number of hexagons before
                    dropping the next seed.

                        When transplanting or planting seeds on spacings of 3 inches
                    or more, try using measuring sticks cut to the required length to

                    determine where each plant should be located. Transplant or sow a
                    seed at each point of the triangulation process. You will eventually

                    be able to transplant with reasonable accuracy without measuring!

                        Once you get the feel for plant spacing, you may want to practice

                        Transplanting seedlings involves more advance planning and

                    more time, but in a small garden, this has several advantages:


                     • Transplanted seedlingsmake better use of bed space. Seeds
                        can take from 5 days to 12 weeks or more to reach transplant-

                        ing size. If that growing is done in a flat, something else can be
                        growing in the bed in the meantime.



                     • You can be reasonably sure that each transplanted seedling will
                        grow into a healthy mature plant. Not all seeds germinate, so

                        no matter how carefully you sow seeds directly in the bed, you
                        can end up with gaps between plants and, therefore, bare soil

                        that allows evaporation.


                     • Plants grow betterif they are evenly spaced. Some seeds are
                        sown by broadcasting, scattering them over the soil. Broad-

                        cast seeds—no matter how evenly you try to scatter them—will

                        inevitably fall in a random pattern, with some closer and some
                        farther apart than the optimal spacing for best plant growth.

                        Plants that are too close together compete with each other for
                        light, water, and nutrients. When plants are too far apart, the
                                                                                                                                      Seeds
                        soil around them may become compacted, more water may
                        evaporate, and space is wasted.



                     • The roots of evenly spaced transplanted seedlings can find
                        nutrients and grow more easily, and their leaves will cover and

                        protect the soil, creating a good mini-climate with better pro-
                        tection for the soil. Carbon dioxide is captured under the leaf

                        canopy of closely spaced plants, where the plants need it for
                        optimal growth.


                     • Transplanting stimulatesgrowth. When you transplant a seed-

                        ling into a double-dug, composted bed that is fluffy, aerated,

                        and full of nutrients, you give it a second “meal” of nutrients,
                        air, and moisture after its first meal in the flat. If the seeds are

                        sown directly in the bed, the soil will begin to re-compact after
                        its initial digging while the seeds are germinating and grow-

                        ing into seedlings. Therefore, the soil will not be as loose for the
                        plants to grow in once the seedling stage is reached.



                     • Seedlings in a flat require much less water (a half-gallon
                        per day) than seedlings in a bed (10 to 20 or more gallons per

                        100 square feet per day).

                                            sustainable soil fertility


      “C   arbon” refers to plant material, also called “biomass,” that has a lot of complex cell structures and meets
      the criteria for mature material for compost building. Carbon farming promotes sustainable soil fertility by
      focusing on growing crops that produce a large amount of carbonaceous material (mature material) for com-
      posting. A farmer in tune with producing enough mature compost material will grow these crops in at least
      60% of the cultivated area. By focusing on growing enough compost material through choosing carbon--ro
      ducing crops, a farmer becomes more self-sufficient, relying on his/her own compost for soil fertility instead
      of buying resources from off of the farm.


      Some crops of importance are: maize, sorghum, amaranth, quinoa, millet, rye, wheat, barley, rice, oats, and
      sunflowers. An important production goal for mature compost material is an average of 30 lb (13.5 kg) of air-
      dry material per 100 ft² (10 m²) bed. A sustainable farming systemffi focuses on crops that have this potential.

      In addition, carbon farming has a diet element. The important cereal
      crops mentioned above also produce an edible seed. Emphasizing crops            HINT:

      ered and supports sustainable soil fertility with more compost material.
      Keeping something growing in the soil at all times is an important farming practice for soil building and
      compost material, worth the extra planning it requires.

                                             Goal: Grow a complete diet
                                             in the smallest area possible


        “C   alorie” refers to the energy that is found in food we eat. Calories are essential for human life and are in
        all food to some degree. Calorie farming produces a complete diet in the smallest space possible by focusing

        on special root crops that are calorie-dense and yield well in a small area. These specific crops are: potatoes,
        sweet potatoes, parsnips, leeks, garlic, Jerusalem artichoke, and salsify. A farm with 30% of its area in special
        root crops maximizes its area-efficient production of calories and can grow a complete diet in the smallest
        space possible.

        After accounting for carbon crops and special root crops, the remaining 10% of area can grow vegetable crops

                      PRINCIPLE 7: OPEN-POLLINATED SEEDS 

                                      Goal: Maximize seed production and
                                       quality and preserve genetic diversity


      U   sing open-pollinated (OP) seeds allows the farmer to save seeds on the farm, providing for future crops
      through growing healthy, locally acclimatized, fresh seeds. This helps create a self-sufficient closed system by
      reducing dependence on large or small seed vendors, and by saving money. It is generally possible to grow all
      the seeds necessary for next year’s garden in about 3% additional area.


      Seed savers must start with OP seeds. This is because hybrid
      seeds have been crossed already, and do not have pure genes;
      seeds saved from hybrid plants will not produce offspring that
      are true to type (have appropriate characteristics for the variety).
      Only offspring from OP seeds will be true to type.

      Saving seeds requires learning how specific crops reproduce.

      Some crops produce seed in one growing season (annuals),
      while others require two seasons for seed production (bienni -
      als). Some crops can self-pollinate while others require pollen
      from another plant to produce seed (cross-pollination). This
      information will help you learn how to grow the seed.

      When growing seed in the garden, the farmer must pay atten -

      tion to the purity of the seed. Pure seed will produce true to
      type offspring, keeping the variety strong and consistent. Seeds
      from some crops, like those that require cross-pollination, are
      naturally more likely to become impurely crossed (hybrids)
      with a different variety or crop. Some plants will even cross
      with wild relatives. To attend to seed purity it is wise to grow
      most crops for seed at a good distance from other varieties and

      other crops in the same family. For crops that cross readily, like
      corn, it may be advisable to grow only one variety each sea-
      son—and that variety 2,000 ft (610 m) from other corn variet-
      ies. Another method of isolating seed from potential crossing
      is to grow varieties that mature at different times, so the pollen
      has no opportunity to cross.                                              A pollinator at work


      In addition to purity, genetic diversity is an important practice of good seed saving. Always save seed from
      a minimum of 5 plants, preferably more. (For corn at least 50 plants are needed.) You can never save seed
      from too many plants (of the same variety). In this way your seed harvest has a wider range of genes and
      traits. This will result in a healthy and diverse crop that will be better able to deal with various challenges of
      life, insects, climate, etc. Over time, seed saved consistently will be more acclimatized to local conditions and
      be more genetically adapted to the area, a benefit of careful seed saving.
                                                                                                            12

         Each type of seed generally has an average number of years it is able to germinate. A seed saver must attend
         to seed storage in such a way that the viability (ability to germinate) and vitality of the seed are supported.
         Conditions that are ideal for seed storage are the opposite of conditions that are good for germination. For

         example, seeds stored in airtight containers in cool and dark places are likely to remain viable longer than
         seeds stored in open containers in warm, sunny places.

                                                   GB Farmer’s Challenge:
          Start small and grow one crop out to seed the first season. Start with a simple crop like dry beans or lettuce. Add
                                other crops over time to produce most of or all of your farm’s seeds.


         Using companion planting, farming for carbon and calories, and using openffi-pollinated seeds are like choos-
         ing the strongest material to make the three-legged stool, so it will truly last. They are actions of intention.
         They allow GB to produce enough compost and food to truly build and sustain the soil, to feed the farmer
         and help the farm approach sustainability.

                     PRINCIPLE 8: WHOLE SYSTEM APPROACH 

                                        Goal: Integrate all the principles
                                        into your garden to create balance


      GB      is a unified farming method, withall eight principles playing an important role in creating a thriving
      mini-ecosystem that sustains itself and its farmers. The closer you can come to a closed system, the more
      sustainable your farming methods will be.

      If, instead of using all the principles on your farm, some principles are used and others are discarded, your
      soil may eventually be in worse condition than when you began. For example, deep soil cultivation partnered
      with intensive planting but without the benefits of compost may strip the soil of fertility and structure.
      Similarly, adding more than a sustainably produced amount of compost or extra biological fertilizer may
      improve crop yields for a few years, but lead to soil imbalances that could cause future insect and disease issues

      and a less-healthy soil. Not growing enough compost material on your own farm may be depleting your soil
      for lack of the compost needed to hold minerals in your soil. Buying materials to build compost may deplete
      someone else’s land.

      The benefits of patient and consistent work necessary to create the healthy soil and the crop diversity inherent
      in the GB method will be evident over time. Though crops may struggle during the first years in challenging
      soil, or insect pests may be an initial problem, careful attention to all eight principles will transform the farm
      into a vigorous ecosystem that grows healthy, high-yielding crops and can keep insect pests in balance.


      GB requires farmers to act with thought and foresight, recognizing that the farm itself is part of a oreater ec-
      system that should be thriving. Keeping half of your land in the wild, if possible, nurtures the plant, insect,
      and animal diversity that surround the farm and provides a buffer that allows it to exist and thrive. In urban
      settings, perhaps an area for native flowers, shrubs, and trees can be a welcome space for visitors that also helps
      support a larger ecosystem.

      This final principle is the essential top of the stool so that, when allffi other principles are considered, you can

      sit and rest with the satisfaction that the stool is well formed, strong and beautiful!

                                        Ultimate GB Farmer’s Challenge:
        When considering any one aspect of the garden, always remember that all things are connected and that only a
       healthy soil will produce healthy crops. Only a healthy system can sustain a healthy soil. Challenge yourself and
                        your neighbors to become aware of and to nurture theWHOLE ecosystem!

      GROW BIOINTENSIVE Sustainable Mini-Farming is an exciting recognition that farmers are important

      people who care for other people and for the land. Be creative as you remember each of the goals and tork-
      ward creating a thriving mini-ecosystem on your farm. Ask yourself if your actions uphold the goal and move
      you toward sustainability. Be patient; knowledge and skill are things that are built by practice, dedication,
      and time—just like soil. Ultimately, start small, do the best with what you have, and learn from everything
      you do. As you master this, you hold a beautiful seed. As a farmer, this seed of knowledge will be in your
      hands to nurture and to share!

                                                      A Biodynamic gardener once had a row of broccoli plants. Only two

                                                      plants had aphids, but both were quite infested. When they were
                                                      dug up, the gardener discovered that the plants had experienced

                                                      root damage during transplanting. The healthy broccoli, which had

                                                      experienced uninterrupted growth, were untouched by the insects,

               out before transplanting them
               into a bed .                               When transplanting, it is important to handle the seedlings
                                                      gently and to touch them as little as possible. Plants do not like

                                                      their bodies to be handled, though they do like to have human com-

                    seedlings after transplanting to help settle the soil around the

                    roots, to eliminate excess air spaces, and to provide an adequate

                    amount of water for growth. As the soil is packed down under the
                    pressure of watering, the final soil level will remain high enough to

                    cover the upper roots. The plant’s roots need firm contact with the

                    soil to properly absorb water and nutrients. Press the soil firmly
                    around the seedling, if necessary, but not too tightly. Tight pack-

                    ing will damage the roots and will not allow the proper penetration                            Proper
                    of water, nutrients, and air. Soil that is too loose will allow air and

                    moisture to concentrate around the roots. This will cause root burn

                    and decay.
                         Transplanting seedlings up to their first true leaves prevents

                    them from becoming top-heavy and bending over during their early
                    growth period. (This is especially true for members of the cabbage

                    family.) If a plant bends over, it will upright itself, but will develop

                    a very “tough neck” that will reduce the quality and size of the                                                       Seeds
                    plant and crop. Onions and garlic, however, do better if the bulb

                    does not have much soil weight to push up against.
                                                                                                                  improper
                         Optimally, transplanting should be done in the early evening
                    so the seedlings get settled into their new home during more mod-

                    erate weather conditions. If transplanting is performed during the
                    day, some temporary shading may be needed. In our hot summer

                    weather, we shade newly transplanted seedlings with 30% shade-

                    netting or Reemay, a row cover cloth, for several days to minimize
                    transplanting shock and wilt.

                         Transplanting is preferable to directly sowing seeds. More

                    importantly, transplanting improves plant health. Beds become
                    compacted as they are watered and the soil will not be as loose for a

                    seed that is planted directly in the bed. Some compaction will have                   Result of improper transplanting
                    occurred by the time the seed is a “child” a month later and, in some

                    cases, so much so after 2 months, when it is likely to be an “adoles-

               7                                   GOAL: Grow a mini-ecosystem thriving with life




                           AN INTERRELATED FOOD-


                 RAISING SYSTEM:                        Creating and


                     Caring for a Balanced Natural

                            Ecosystem with Insect Lifje


                 nsects and people are only part of the complex, interrelated
                 world of life. Both are important, integral parts of its living
              I  dynamism. Insects are an important part of the diet for many
               birds, toads, and frogs, and for some insects in nature’s complex
               food chain. The GROW BIOINTENSIVE method reminds you that
               every time you relate to an insect you are relating to the whole
               system of life, and that if you choose to dominate the insect popula-
               tion, rather than work in harmony with it, part of the system dies.
               For example, we depend on insects to pollinate many of our vegeta-
               bles, fruits, flowers, herbs, fibers, and cover crops. When we choose
               dominating, death-oriented control, then the scope and depth of our
               lives become narrower and smaller. We are actually detracting from
               our lives rather than adding to them. In trying to isolate an insect
               and deal with it separately out of relation to the ecosystem in
               which it lives, we work against nature, which in turn works against
               us in counterproductive results.
                 When an excess of insects appears in a garden, nature is indi-
               cating that a problem exists in the life of that garden. In each case,
               we need to become sensitive to the source o- the imbalance. Obser
               vation and gentle action will produce the best results. In contrast,

                                                   when a heavy-handed approach is taken and poisons are used, ben-
                                                   eficial predators are killed as well as the targeted harmful insects.

                                                   Spraying trees to eliminate worms or beetles often results in a sec-

                                                   ondary outbreak of spider mites or aphids because ladybugs and
                                                   other predators cannot reestablish themselves as quickly as the

                                                   destructive species.
                                                       Paying attention to the soil and to plant health, planning a va-r

                                                   ied environment, and leaving a few wild spaces for unexpected bene-
                                                   factors minimize pest losses more effectively than the use of poison.

                                                   Also, in order to have beneficial insects in your food-producing area,
                                                   you must provide food for them—which may be some of the harm-

                                                   ful insects! If there are no harmful insects to feed them, then there
                                                   will be few, if any, beneficial insects around to act as friendly guard-

                                                   ians for your garden. This seeming paradox—the need for both kinds

                                                   of insects for the healthiest garden—is symbolic of nature’s bal-
                                                   ances. Not too much moisture, but enough. Not too much aeration,

                                                   but enough. Not too many harmful insects, but enough. You find the
                                                   need for these balances everywhere—in the compost pile, in the soil,

                                                   in the mini-climate, and in the backyard microcosm as a whole.
                                                       In a small backyard garden ecosystem or mini-farm, it is espe-

                                                   cially important to welcome all life-forms as much as possible. Ants
                                                   destroy fruit fly and housefly larvae and keep the garden cleared

                                                   of rotting debris. Have you ever squashed a snail and watched how
                                                   the ants come to whisk the remains away almost within a day? Ear        -

                                                   wigs are carnivorous and prey on other insects. Tachinid flies para-

                                                   sitize caterpillars, earwigs, tomato worms, and grasshoppers by
                                                   laying their eggs in them. We’ve found cabbage worms immobilized

                                                   and bristling with cottony white torpedoes the size of a pinhead—
                                                   larvae of the braconid wasp, which will hatch and go in search of

                                                   more cabbage worms. Toads eat earwigs, slugs, and other pests.
                                                   Chickens control earwigs, sowbugs, and flies. Even the ancient and

                                                   fascinating snails have a natural predator: humans!
                                                       The first step in insect control is to cultivate strong, vigor-

                                                   ous plants by cultivating a healthy place where they can grow.
                                                   Normally (about 90% of the time), insects only attack unhealthy

                                                   plants. Just as a healthy person who eats good food is less suscep-

                                                   tible to disease, so are healthy plants on a good diet less susceptible
                                                   to plant disease and insect attack. The insect is not the source of

                                                   the problem, but rather an unhealthy soil is. The soil needs your
                                                   energy, not the insect. The uninterrupted growth that the GROW

                        Here are some elements to consider when caring for your

                    garden’s health:


                     • Did you dig the soil properly?


                     • Are the proper plant nutrients available in the soil?


                     • Did you use enough compost?


                     • Is the soil pH within reasonable limits for the plant being

                        grown?


                     • Did you transplantthe seedlings properly?


                     • Are you watering the plants properly?


                     • Are you weeding effectively?


                     • Are you maintaining    the soil in a way that will enable it to

                        retain moisture and nutrients?


                     • Are the plants receiving enough sun?


                     • Are you growing the plants in season?


                        Another factor that aids plant health and minimizes insect and

                    disease problems is keeping a correct balance of phosphorus and
                    potash in the soil in relation to the amount of nitrogen present.

                    The optimal ratio among these elements is still to be determined.
                    Research also needs to be completed to determine the minimum
                                                                                                                                     Natural Ecosystem
                    amounts of these elements (in pounds per 100 square feet) that
                    should be in the soil. (Smaller amounts of organic fertilizer elements

                    are required in comparison with soluble synthetic chemical fertilizers,

                    since they break down more slowly and remain available to the
                    plants for a longer period of time.)

                        Properly planning the garden can eliminate many insect and
                    disease problems.


                     • Use seeds that   grow well in your climate and soil.



                     • Use plant varietiesthat are weather hardy, insect resistant,
                        and disease resistant. New strains, especially hybrids (whether

                        developed for higher yields, disease resistance, or other reasons),

                                                       should usually be avoided. Some hybrids produce foods of lower
                                                       nutritive value in comparison with older strains, and often use

                                                       can sustain over time. Hybrids also tend to be very susceptible

                                                       to a few diseases even when they are greatly resistant to many
                                                       prevalent ones.


                                                    • Companion plant. Growvegetables and flowers together that

                                                       grow well with each other.


                                                    • Avoid putting the same vegetable in the same growing bed each

                                                       year. This practice invites disease.


                                                    • Rotate your crops;follow heavy feeders with heavy givers and

                                                   Encourage natural insect control by enlisting the aid of Nature.


                                                   Birds—Some are vegetarians. Others are omnivorous. A bird that

                                                   stops for a seed snack may remain for an insect dinner. A house

                                                   5,000 ants as a snack. A Baltimore oriole can consume 17 hairy cat-

                                                   erpillars in a minute. You can encourage the presence of birds with
                                                   moving water, by planting bushes for their protection, by planting

                                                   sour berry bushes for food, and by growing plants that have seeds
                                                   they like to eat.


                                                   Toads, snakes, and spiders—They also eat insects and other gar         -

                                                   den pests. Toads eat as many as 10,000 insects in 3 months, includ-
                                                   ing cutworms, slugs, crickets, ants, caterpillars, and squash bugs.


                                                   Ladybugs—These beetles are good predators in your garden since

                                                   they eat a single particular pest, aphids, and do not eat beneficial
                                                   insects. Ladybugs eat 40 to 50 insects per day, and their larvae eat

                                                   even more.

                    insects. They are not selective and even eat each other.


                    Trichogramma wasps—They lay their eggs in hosts, such as

                    moth and butterfly larvae, that eat leaves. When they hatch, the
                    wasp larvae parasitize the host larvae, which fail to reach maturity.

                    Up to 98% of the hosts are rendered useless in this way.

                        After you have done everything possible to provide a healthy,

                    balanced garden for your plants, you may still have insect prob-
                    lems. If so, you should approach the unwanted insects with the idea

                    of living control rather than elimination. If there is a problem, iden-
                    tify the pest and try to determine whether anenvironmental change

                    can solve the problem. In our research garden, we have minimized
                    (not eliminated, though) gophers by introducing gopher snakes.

                    76,000 are considered beneficial or friendly.   So, be careful! An
                    insect that looks ugly or malicious may be a friend. If you can’t

                    our test beds. The primary leaves were almost entirely destroyed

                    by the twelve-spotted cucumber beetle. But in most cases the dam-
                    age was not so rapid as to prevent the development of healthy sec-

                    ondary leaves. The less tender secondary leaves were ultimately
                    attacked and quite heavily eaten. About 80% of the secondary leaf

                    area remained, however, and we harvested very tasty, unblemished
                    beans. The yield in pounds was still 3.9 times the United States

                    average! Recent tests have shown that leaf damage of up to 30%

                    by insects can actually increase the yield in some crops. You may
                    decide to sacrifice some yield for beauty; many destructive caterpil-

                                                   to encourage the presence of butterflies, you can plant extra plants
                                                   of the crops they like.

                                                       We often underestimate the ability of plants to take care of

                                                   themselves. The damage done by insects often affects only a very
                                                   small percentage of the edible crop. Because of this, many GROW

                                                   BIOINTENSIVE gardeners plant a little extra for the insect world
                                                   to eat. This practice is beautiful, mellow, and in keeping with life-

                                                   giving forms of insect control. Furthermore, extensive research
                                                   has shown that beneficial organisms found in soil and ocean envi-

                                                   ronments can withstand stress, in the form of temperature, pres-
                                                   sure, pH, and nutrient fluctuations, to a much greater degree in

                                                   an organically fertilized medium than in a synthetically fertilized
                                                   medium. I suspect researchers will come to a similar conclusion

                                                   about plant resistance to insect attack.

                                                       Any time an insect or other pest invades your garden, there is
                                                   an opportunity to learn more about nature’s cycles and balances.

                                                   Learn why they are there and find aliving control. Look for con-

                                                   from birds and squirrels with netting or chicken wire, trap earwigs
                                                   in dry dark places, wash aphids off with a strong spray of water, or

                                                   or a tack trap. While you are doing this, continue to strive for a

                                                       At our Common Ground Research Garden, only 3 pest prob-

                                                   lems have taken a lot of our energy: snails, slugs, and gophers.

                                                   The first few years we primarily trapped gophers. A lot of time was
                                                   spent checking and resetting traps and worrying about them, yet

                                                   the gophers probably only damaged about 5% of our crop. We later
                                                   found that, in addition to gopher snakes, they really do not like cer    -

                                                   tain things placed in their holes (sardines, garlic juice, fish heads,
                                                   male urine, and dead gophers). The gophers may also be blocked

                                                   with strips of daffodils. Daffodils contain arsenic in their bulbs and
                                                   can discourage them. Gopher snakes, of course, prevent a popula-

                                                   tion explosion. A combination of approaches and gentle persistence
                                                   paid off.

                                                       We have a simple routine for snails and slugs. At the end of the

                                                   spring rains we go out at night with flashlights and collect gallons
                                                   of them. We drop the snails in buckets of soapy water, which kills

                                                   them. If we use soap that is quick to degrade, we can dump them
                                                   on the compost pile the next day. We catch most of them in the first

                                                   3 nights. Going out occasionally over the next 2 weeks, we can catch
                                                   new ones that were too small to get in the first sweep or that have

                    can be effective for several months. The red-bellied snake eats large
                    numbers of slugs. A sorghum mulch is reported to repel slugs as well.

                       Another kind of problem has been solved through observation.
                    For example, one year a cherry tomato bed was wilting. Several

                    people, including a graduate student studying insects, told us it was
                    caused by nematodes. When we dug down into the soil to look for

                    the damage, we discovered the real source. The soil was bone dry
                    below the upper 8 inches. A good soaking took care of the problem,

                    and we learned not to take gardening advice on faith, but to always

                    check it out for ourselves—as we hope you will.

                    certain the insect involved is harmful and is the source of the prob-

                    lem. Some insects are only harmful in one stage and can even be
                    beneficial in other stages.


                    Spraying—In general, insects may be divided into two categories—

                    those that chew and bite plants and those that suck juices from
                    them.


                     • Chewing or biting insects include caterpillars, flea beetles,

                       potato bugs, cankerworms, cutworms, and grasshoppers.

                       Aromatic and distasteful substances such as garlic, onion,
                       and pepper sprays can discourage them.
                                                                                                                                    Natural Ecosystem

                     • Sucking insects includeaphids, thrips, squash bug nymphs, flies,

                       and scale insects. Soap solutions (not detergents, which would
                       damage the plant and soil as well as the insects), clear miscible

                       oil solutions, and other solutions that asphyxiate the insects by
                       coating their tender bodies and preventing respiration through

                       body spiracles or breathing holes help control these insects.


                    Traps—Some traps, such as shredded newspaper in clay pots
                    turned upside down on sticks in the garden, will attract earwigs

                    during daylight hours. Snails, slugs, sowbugs, and symphylans can
                    be trapped under damp boards or sweet potatoes cut in half length-

                    ways. They retreat to these places in the heat and light of the day.

                                                   some insects crawling along tree trunks during part of their life

                                                   cycle. Catching insects in this manner often prevents infestation

                                                   Grow a vegetable or flower preferred by a particular insect away
                                                   from the garden to attract it to another location. Place repellent

                                                   plants near a vegetable or flower that needs protection.


                                                   Companion plants—You may also wish to plant some herbs in
                                                   your bed for insect control. The age and number of plants used per

                                                   100 square feet determine the herb’s effectiveness. A young plant

                                                   does not have an aroma or root exudate strong enough to discour       -
                                                   age harmful insects or to attract beneficial ones. Similarly, too

                                                   few herbs will not control a pest or attract a needed predator. But
                                                   too many herbs may retard vegetable growth and yield. Compos-

                                                   ite flowers, such as pot marigolds (calendulas) and sunflowers, are
                                                   excellent attractants for predatory insects because their large sup-

                                                   plies of pollen serve as predator food sources. A few (2 to 4) plants
                                                   per 100-square-foot bed will probably suffice. We have not done

                                                   many experiments with them yet, since accurate testing can take
                                                   2 to 3 years for 1 herb grown with 1 food plant to control 1 insect.

                                                   You may wish to try some of these biodynamic observations, though.

                                                   It’s a lot of fun to try to see for yourself!
                                                       Probably the most important form of insect control with plants

                                                   is just diverse cropping. The GROW BIOINTENSIVE method we
                                                   use utilizes diverse cropping, and we have only experienced 5% to

                                                   10% crop loss due to pests. Biodynamic gardeners and farmers also
                                                   use diverse cropping and have suggested planting 10% more area

                                                   to make up for crop losses. In contrast, the monocropped acreage of
                                                   today’s commercial agriculture provides an ideal uniform habitat

                                                   for widespread attack by pests that favor a single crop. Pesticides
                                                   have been used to counteract the problem inherent in monocropping.

                                                   Yet the Environmental Protection Agency estimated that in 1940,

                                                   “American farmers used 50 million pounds of pesticides and lost 7%
                                                   of their crop before harvest,” and that by 1970, 12 times more pesti-

                                                   cides were used, “yet the percentage of crops lost before harvest has
                                                   almost doubled.”  3Today, about 30 times more pesticides are used

                                                   than in 1940, and the percentage of crops lost to insects has been
                                                   estimated to be as high as 37%. In fact, many pesticides targeted

                                                         It is evident that pesticides are not an effective solution for crop

                                                     losses due to pests. Diverse cropping without pesticides may be able
                                                     to reduce total pest losses more than monocropping with pesticides,

      \            APPENDI x 1\n\n\n\n\n\n             Tools\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n             One
      of Ecology Action’s goals has been to develop Biointensive\n             techniques
      that use as few procedures as possible, and as few tools\n\n             as
      possible, preferably manual ones. Our philosophy has been\n             to encourage
      the use of what we describe as sophisticated low-\n\n             technology
      tools—tools that are inexpensive, simple, easy to build,\n             yet highly
      functional. We wanted to avoid high initial capital invest-\n\n             ment
      and the high cost of running, maintaining, and repairing com-\n             plex
      mechanical equipment.\n\n                 Cars have important purposes, but
      consider the true cost of\n             running one, not to mention the pollution
      it creates. Ivan Illich,\n\n             author of Tools for Conviviality and
      advocate of a simpler life, one\n             remarked that if everyone added
      up all the time spent earning the\n\n             money to purchase, maintain,
      fuel, and drive an automobile, they\n             would see that each person
      is really only traveling at four miles per\n\n             hour in a car—the
      speed of the common bicycle! Recently, a study\n             was made of the
      time the average stay-at-home mom in the United\n\n             States spends
      working in, around, and for the home and family. It\n             was discovered
      that, even with labor-saving tools, she spends the\n             same amount
      of time that her counterpart spent one hundred years\n\n             ago! Why
      not look for ways to maximize simplicity, sophistication,\n             and
      quality, and yet get jobs done more quickly? This has been our\n\n             goal
      in developing tools for mini-farming.\n                 Early on in our research
      programs, we identified the need for\n\n             four tools in particular
      that were available, but not quite in the form\n             we needed. They
      were: 1) theU-bar, a large spading fork or kind of\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                                  191\n\n\n\nJeav_9781607741893_4p_03_r2.indd

      and pest control; 3) a watering tool that could water three\n                                              times
      as rapidly and three times more gently (to avoid harming plants\n\n                                              or

      now a reality, and plans and specifications for these two tools are\n\n                                              included
      in this chapter. In addition, there are plans and specs for a\n                                              soil
      and compost sifter, seedling flat, and row marker.\n\n                                                  We
      invite you to build these tools as presented here, and to\n                                              make
      your own modifications. Any modifications to the U-bar\n\n                                              should
      be performed with special care, however, as it is the result of\n\n                                              a
      special, lengthy research, development and testing process. Any\n                                              modifications
      which make it less strong could be dangerous for the\n\n                                              user.
      Currently we are trying to find a good durable design for a\n                                              U-bar
      with detachable handles so it can be more easily transported.\n\n                                              We
      also believe that the mini-greenhouse can be improved upon to\n                                              make
      interchangeable panels fit into a single structure, rather than\n\n                                              two.
      Your suggestions can help us with this ongoing design process.\n\n\n\n                                              u-Bar

      Traditionally, the soil is loosened to a\n         Illustrations: Pedro J. Gonzalez\n

      spading fork in a process called the\n                                              double-dig.
      The first time a plot of ground is worked, the double-\n\n                                              dig
      can take anywhere from 2 to 6 hours per 100-square-foot raised\n                                              bed,
      depending on the soil’s condition and the skill of the practi-\n\n                                              tioner.
      After the ground has been double-dug and cropped once, it\n                                              generally
      takes about 2 hours thereafter to double-dig and shape a\n\n                                              raised
      bed using a spade and fork.\n\n                                                  There
      is a less time-consuming and less tiring way to prepare\n                                              a
      raised bed while deeply aerating the soil. Once we have initially\n\n                                              double-dug
      our beds, we often use a U-bar for subsequent cultivation\n                                              in
      our test beds. Since the U-bar tines do not dig quite as deeply and\n\n                                              do
      not aerate the soil as much as a double-dig with spade and fork,\n                                              we
      still double-dig the soil periodically when significantly increased\n\n                                              soil
      compaction is noticed. Another disadvantage of U-barring is that\n\n                                              the
      gardener loses personal contact with the different strata of the\n                                              soil
      and may not be aware of changes in soil quality due to different\n\n                                              soil-preparation
      techniques, crops grown, or soil amendments used.\n                                              Yet
      the time savings the U-bar offers is significant. Each person will\n\n                                              need
      to decide which factors are most important.\n\n\n\n\n\n         192                                  Appendix

      1\n                     The U-bar is essentially a very large spading fork with
      two han-\n                dles mounted on opposite ends of a rack of 18-inch-long
      tines. The\n\n                U-bar has cut our soil cultivation time from 2
      hours per 100-square-\n\n                foot bed to 10 to 30 minutes per bed.
      It is simple to use, and reduces\n\n                the bending and lifting
      motions of digging. It loosens and aerates\n\n                the soil with
      a minimum of soil strata mixing. Its only constraint is\n\n                that
      it can only be used in well-loosened soil (usually soil that has\n                been
      double-dug for at least one season).\n\n                     Two undergraduate
      engineering students at Stanford Univer                   -\n\n                sity
      designed and built two types of U-bars for Ecology Action using\n                                                                       1\n

      design presented\n\n                here is the one preferred by Ecology Action—both
      for ease of con-\n                struction and for effectiveness in preparing
      the soil. The updated\n\n                drawings should allow a competent welder
      to construct one with\n\n                little difficulty. It is not intended

      \                                                   The designers of the U-bar
      found that a 2-foot-wide tool with\n\n                                                18-inch-long
      tines is as large as the U-bar can be made. Otherwise\n\n                                                it
      becomes too difficult for a person of average size and strength to\n                                                operate.\n\n
      \                                                   The frame of the U-bar is
      1    1/4-inch-square tubing with a wall\n                                                thickness
      of 0.095 inches. The elbow and brace pieces are 1-inch-\n\n                                                square
      tubing of the same thickness. The frame material is hot-\n\n                                                rolled,
      low-carbon steel, also known as “mild” steel or 1010/1020\n                                                steel.\n\n
      \                                                   The tines of the U-bar are
      half-round bar, plow steel stock. If\n\n                                                plow
      steel is unavailable, use cold-rolled steel. The gussets on the\n                                                back
      of the tine are  1/8 inch thick and 1 inch deep. The stand-up bar\n                                                                          1\n

      material and is welded to the\n                                                tops
      of the gussets the whole width of the U-bar and is flush with\n\n                                                the
      top of the square tubing.\n\n                                                    Material
      costs are dependent upon the quantity ordered. If\n                                                bought
      new from a dealer, steel is usually sold in 20-foot sections.\n\n                                                    The
      U-bar makes a highly efficient form of personal food pro-\n                                                duction
      possible. The design was kept simple so that the tool could\n\n                                                be
      available to anyone. Often in this industrialized world, simple,\n\n                                                efficient

      of as too simple or not innovative enough. Yet, for us, the\n\n                                                U-bar

      \              Other Possibilities\n\n               We have made a second mini-greenhouse,
      but instead of enclosing it\n\n               with plastic, we have used birdnetting
      as the covering of the panels.\n               Shadenetting, which screens out
      much more light than birdnetting\n\n               or pestnetting, can then
      be placed on top of the birdnetting in order\n\n               to control the
      amount of sunlight that the bed receives. (Shadenet-\n               ting could
      be cut large enough to allow a 1- to 1     12-inch hem to be\n\n               sewn
      around the edges to prevent it from unraveling. It can then\n\n               simply
      be attached with machine screws and washers.)\n                   Extra panels
      can be made so that plastic and netting panels can\n\n               be combined
      in the same greenhouse to meet specific weather or\n\n               horticultural
      requirements.\n                   Another possibility would be the routing out
      of the 2 x 2 frames\n\n               and making removable panels instead of
      needing two separate\n               structures.\n\n                   Let us
      know your experiences building and growing with this\n\n               mini-greenhouse/shabdenetting
      house/birdnetting house/pestnetting\n               house. Suggestions for improvements
      are welcome.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            Appendix

      SiFTer\n\n\n         Design: Steve Shuck                      When we first
      started working the Common Ground Garden, Steve\n         Drawing Development:
      Pedro Klauder\n         Illustrations: Pedro J. Gonzalez         Shuck, a longtime
      Ecology Action member and supporter, saw we\n\n                                                  had
      a periodic need for large amounts of sifted soil and compost for\n                                                  seeding
      flats and sometimes for covering small seeds in the growing\n\n                                                  beds.
      As a result, he created a soil sifter for use with two 4-cubic-foot\n\n                                                  wheelbarrows.
      One wheelbarrow holds the soil to be sifted, while the\n\n                                                  second
      stands underneath the sifter to catch the refined soil.\n                                                       The
      unsifted soil is placed on a screened “pan” that swings back\n\n                                                  and
      forth to speed the process. Pans with different mesh galvanized-\n\n                                                  wire
      “cloth” can be used depending on the size of the sifted particles\n\n                                                  needed.
      At the back of the pan is a hinged side which allows the\n                                                  clods
      which will not pass through the mesh to fall to the ground\n\n                                                  behind
      the sifter. The clods are later shoveled into the empty wheel-\n\n                                                  barrow
      and used as soil in the compost layering process. This tool\n                                                  made
      things a lot easier for us.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n         204                                      Appendix

      materials. The design given below is for a standard flat, 14 inches\n                                                   1\n

      planting centers, or about\n\n                 60 2-inch planting centers. You
      can make a flat any size that you like,\n                 but remember that
      the larger the flat, the heavier it will be (because\n\n                 of
      the soil contained within it) and some shapes are awkward to carry.\n\n\n\n\n\n

      spacing is called by various names such as pricking out,\n\n                                             bumping

      when you are dealing with thousands, and most likely\n                                             tens

      streamlining the process; the dibble board follows to create an\n                                             efficient
      system.\n\n                                                 Often the experienced

      a backward motion). Even with the proficiency of such a skill,\n\n                                             the
      dibble board is faster. Also, often the mini-farm may be utilizing\n                                             newly
      skilled labor, apprentices, etc. This dibble board really helps\n\n                                             to
      improve efficiency and get the spacing correct (to have consistent\n\n                                             numbers
      in flats, maximize growth, and have uniform transplants).\n                                                 The
      key to effectively using this tool is to have the proper flat\n\n                                             soil,
      soil moisture, and correctly sized seedlings. The seedlings\n                                             should
      have only two leaves and have no more than a few simple\n\n                                             branched
      roots off the main root when they are placed in this soil. If\n                                             they
      are too big they simply will not fit in. If they are too small they\n\n                                             slide
      down the dibble hole, making it difficult to maintain the proper\n                                             depth
      of the seedling. Flat soil can be used. Moisture should be suf-\n\n                                             ficient
      to allow good penetration of the dibbles into the soil, but not\n                                             enough
      moisture to stick to the dibbles or too little, which causes the\n\n                                             walls
      of the dibble hole to cave in when the dibble is removed. If you\n\n                                             get
      the moisture just right, it is a dream to use. When the process is\n                                             working

         I = Income: can provide a significant portion of income

         N = Nitrogen: concentrates a significant (n = less significant) amount of nitrogen in the plant
         O = Oil: can be used for oil
         SS = Soil structure: can significantly (SS = very significantly) improve soil structure asit grows
             and the roots decompose in t[-SS] = Appears to deplete soil structure

                        PRINCIPLE 4: COMPANION PLANTING

                                         Goal: Focus on the whole garden
                                     to create a thriving mini-ecosystem with
                                           beneficial interrelationships


        C  ompanion planting strengthens the whole farm by crop and layout choices that support beneficial rela-
        tionships between plants, insects, and the soil.

        Companion planting includes choosing crops that are                   HINT:
        good neighbors and encourage each other’s growth.   Plant a deep- and thick-rooting grain like rye after
        Good companion plants can follow one another in the a root crop to loosen the soil. Interplant beans with
        same area, grow next to one another at the same time,
        or be interplanted to cooperatively share the same   corn to help support soil nitrogen and efficiently
        space. Avoid putting plants in the same area or space use the above-soil area while covering the soil
                                                            thoroughly. Plant basil near tomatoes to encourage
        that inhibit each other’s growth. Observing patterns           both growth and flavor.
        can teach you a lot about companion plants.

        Companion planting draws a diverse insect population to the garden by using plants of many types and
        colors that flower all-season long. Additionally, a place for insects to drink water and to be protected at night
        can be helpful. These actions will support a balance of beneficial insects that prey on insect pests and pollinate
        the crops. Lastly, choosing strong-scented plants, like marigolds, will help repel unwanted insects.

        Crop rotation is another way to use companion planting. Crop rotation means that crops of the same family
        are not planted in the same place within three years, creating diversity in the bed and over time AND mini-

        mizing disease pressure; therefore caring for the living soil and the whole garden.

      STANDARDS FOR        GROW BIOINTENSIVE              SUSTAINABLE MINI-FARMING






















      GROW BIOINTENSIVE Sustainable Mini-Farming is a remarkable method for increasing yields,
      decreasing resource use, and building soil fertility at very low cost. When used properly, it has the potential

      to change our world for the better. However, when putting this method into practice, it is important to be
      aware that GROW BIOINTENSIVE is a whole system, and that the components of the system must all be
      used together to be sustainable.

      If you are using GROW BIOINTENSIVE, be aware that if you do not use all of the components of the
      system together, the method’s high yields can rapidly deplete the soil, and can potentially cause as much
      damage to your land as conventional farming practices.

      If you use all of the components of the system together, the method can build up the soil rapidly while
      producing higher yields and conserving resources.
      We are eager for people to put GROW BIOINTENSIVE into practice, but we want to make certain that
      each farmer is aware that their garden or mini-farm is only as sustainable as the techniques used by the

      farmer. For this reason, we have created the following “check-list” to help you keep track of your progress
      away from soil-depletion and ecosystem destruction, and towards true, abundant sustainability.


      To be considered as a true GROW BIOINTENSIVE Sustainable Mini-Farm, the garden, mini-farm, or
      farm of an individual, project, program, or organization must be using a specific group of practices in a
      specific way. These practices are grouped in three levels of increasing involvement:


                          1. BASIC  GROW BIOINTENSIVE         MINI-FARMER

               2. TRANSITIONAL   GROW BIOINTENSIVE         SUSTAINABLE MINI-FARMER

                    3. FULL GROW BIOINTENSIVE          SUSTAINABLE MINI-FARMER

       To see what level of sustainability your farm or garden has achieved, please read the following lists,
            and check off the practices which apply to your garden, mini-farm or farm at this time.

                                   BASIC   GROW BIOINTENSIVE              MINI-FARMER















                                                  SOIL PREPARATION

           Manual double-digging (24 inches/60 cm deep), to establish or reestablish good soil structure.
           Surface cultivation (2 inches/5 cm deep) once good soil structure is established, to maximize preservation of soil
              structure.

          Permanent growing beds a minimum of three feet (1 meter) wide, to ensure an optimal mini-climate.

                                                         COMPOST

          Regular use of cured compost in theGROW BIOINTENSIVE     growing area, to maximize soil water retention, soil
              structure building, and microbial diversity for soil health.
          Non-use of green-manure practices, to avoid depletion of significant amount of soil humus.
          Minimal use of composted animal manure (less than one-sixth by volume of organic matter inputs), to avoid salt

              build-up and to minimize carbon lost through animal metabolism and compost curing process.

                                                       FERTILIZER

          Use of only organic fertilizers (on a one-time-only basis whenever possible).

                                        PLANT PROPAGATION AND SPACING

          Close GROW BIOINTENSIVE     off-set spacing, to protect soil with a “living mulch” of plants.
          Use of flats or nursery beds for raising of seedlings and transplanting of seedlings into beds for most crops, to

                                                          Foreword

        A “Peak” in any supply and demand situation means that the highest point in available supplies has been reached,

        and a decline in availability is beginning to be experienced. Currently, our civilization is beginning to experience
        a situation of “Peak Oil,” and there is widespread concern over this external energy crisis because it seems beyond
        our control. The challenge of global warming is connected to this situation, and additional, related global chal-
        lenges are beginning to emerge: challenges which will affect us all on a per person basis as natural resources be-
        come less and less available. These include peak farmable Soil, peak farm water, and peak food—global problems

        that affect each of us as individuals, and all of us as a whole.

        When faced with large-scale issues like these, is easy to get caught up in thinking that the only solutions have to be
        BIG solutions—solutions that we cannot possibly participate in as individuals or communities. But this is not the

        case. The real energy crisis is mainly an internal one, of human energy! We are the source of and the solution to
        the “Energy Crisis.” The wonderful thing is that there is a lot we can do to address the crisis by building sustain-
        ability into our own lives.

        This booklet, which evolved over 20 years of astonishingly meticulous data collection by Steve Moore, provides

        a good place to start the building process. In it, Steve shows us that by incorporating energy-efficient food pro-
        duction into our lives, each of us can become an important part of the solution. Increasing energy efficiency in
        our agricultural systems is an activity that most people can engage in, and can do a lot to help us achieve a more
        sustainable way of life. It is our hope that this booklet will inspire you to become a part of the solution by growing
        your own food using the GROW BIOINTENSIVE method. We also hope that it will encourage experts in the field

        of agricultural energy use to conduct more in-depth scientific investigation in this important area.

        (GB) , which has the production of healthy, nutritious food, reduced energy and resource use, and increased
        soil fertility as its core. The GB method uses several “essential elements” in specific combination to create a fully

        functional sustainable farming system, including: deep soil preparation and soil building; production of carbon
        and nitrogen through compost crops; intensive planting and companion planting; careful diet design; use of open
        pollinated seeds; and use of low-tech (human, rather than fossil-fuel-powered) tools. These elements are key to
        achieving true sustainability in agriculture.


        This paper is an effort to recognize some of the ways in which our current agricultural model wastes energy, and
        to show some of the ways in which energy efficiency may be increased through various methods, including home
        production and the use of the GROW BIOINTENSIVE method.


        The challenge we face is to take responsibility for our own energy use and food sovereignty in order to increase our
        efficiency and sustainability and reduce our impact on the systems we depend upon. If we face this challenge using
        the right tools and information, and if we bring the human heart and mind back into the equation, each of us can

        make a “world of difference” for ourselves and the planet—by growing our own food and efficiently converting
        renewable energy into abundance for all.


                            Energy Sustainability and Food Production

        In 2007, the annual U.S. energy budget was 100 quadrillion (quad, 10x10) BTU. To put that number in perspective,
        consider that 1 quad BTU is equal to the amount of energy in 45 million tons of coal, or 1 trillion cubic feet of
        natural gas, or 170 million barrels of crude oil. Of the 2007 energy total, 85% of the overall energy was derived

        from fossil fuel, and 17.5% of the total was used in the food production system (USDA, 2010).

        Chart 1 illustrates the way energy flows through our current food system. Although energy for food represents
        only one-sixth of the total energy used, waste and inefficiency in growing, processing and shipping the food mean

        that the energy is somewhat wasted. This waste is evident in the fact that the current food production model
        invests, on average, 13 units of non-renewable energy inputs and receives only 1 unit        of food energy output in
        return (Pimentel, 2002). This is certainly poor investment of a fixed capital, particularly at a time when energy is

        becoming an increasingly precious commodity. As the overall food system energy is allocated, only about one-
        fifth (21%) of the energy is actually used in production. As seen in Chart 1, another 14% is used in transportation,
        16% in processing, 7% in packaging, 7% in restaurants, 4% in food retailing and an amazing 32% expended on
        home storage and preparation (Murray, 2005).


        As we review the energy flow through our food production system to determine ways in which we can conserve
        energy and make the system more sustainable and efficient, one can see potentially significant energy savings to
        be gained through home food production. Potential savings can also be added through diet selection; reduction

        of food waste; reduction or elimination of excess energy expenditures in transportation, processing, packaging,
        preservation, storage, and retailing; and incorporating more energy-efficient food production methods, such as
        Biointensive/GB practices. Exploring these areas yields some interesting information.


        Diet Selection

        By incorporating dietary changes into our lives and our food system, we can greatly reduce the amount of energy
        required for food production. It is widely accepted that, as compared with the standard American diet which
        includes large quantities of energy-intensive animal protein, vegetarian and vegan diets offer significant energy
        savings and a corresponding reduction in greenhouse gas emissions (Foley, 2011; Pimentel, 2003). Conversion

          1To differentiate other Biointensive production methods from Ecology Action’s efforts to create a truly sustainable approach, the trademarked term
          GROW BIOINTENSIVE® is used to denote Ecology Action's holistic system of essential elements required to attain sustainable production.

        Home and Community-Based Food Systems

        The food we eat usually travels long distances before it is consumed, running up the energy tab. Actual figures
        vary for this expenditure, but several representative numbers serve to illustrate the scale of travel and the resultant
        energy use/GHG emissions. For example, a 1997 study of food in Maryland showed that produce traveled 1,685.5
        miles from the state where it was produced in order to reach consumers (Hora, 2001). Another study of fresh

        produce arriving at the Chicago distribution terminal (prior to delivery through the Midwest region) showed that
        the food traveled a distance of 1,518 miles just to reach that distribution point (Pirog, 2003). Local consumer
        transportation expenditures can also reflect unsustainable and inefficient energy use. For example, a car traveling
        six miles round-trip (at 25 miles/gallon) to carry a dozen eggs, half a gallon of milk and a loaf of bread brings

        home a total of 2,102 edible Calories while expending 7,500 Calories worth of gasoline (author’s calculations). This
        transportation energy cost is three times the caloric energy value of the food obtained.

        In order for our food system to approach sustainability, these are the types of inefficient practices we must identify
        and minimize. Thus, home production (or production within walking/bicycling distance) can provide a substantial

        reduction in transportation energy (and cost) and should be a significant component of a sustainable food system.

        Food Preservation and Preparation

        Currently, the processing and storage methods that provide us with a year-round food supply can use significant
        quantities of energy. If recent efforts toward food localization are to succeed, a greater emphasis must be placed on
        sustainable food storage and processing to provide for year-round needs. Alternatives such as fermentation and

        solar dehydration provide some of the most sustainable ways of reducing food-storage energy requirements. For
        a more detailed discussion, see page 15, Energy Considerations in Food Processing and Preserving.

        In addition to using more energy-efficient processing methods, significant savings can be achieved by increasing
        the efficiency of home refrigeration. Home food preparation and refrigeration accounts for 32% of the overall

        energy use in the current food system, and home refrigeration uses about half of that total. Homeowners seeking
        ways to increase energy efficiency may consider investing in a new refrigerator: on average, a new model uses half
        the energy of a 10-year-old similarly-sized unit (University of Michigan, 2006).


        Food Production and GROW BIOINTENSIVE Agriculture
        Production accounts for only one-fifth of the total energy used in the U.S. food system. However, it receives a lot of

        attention as a source of potential energy savings, and rightly so. As with food waste, what seems like a small percentage
        of the total represents a large amount of energy that can be saved through improved efficiency. Investigations into
        conventional agricultural production systems have repeatedly shown that energy inputs (primarily as fossil fuels)
        are greater than energy outputs (Gussow, 1991; Pimentel, 2008). Mechanized organic production does little better,

        despite energy savings from the elimination of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides (Pimentel, 1983; Dalgaard,
        2001; Ziesemer, 2007). One recent study of a 180-share Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) farm using
        conventional agricultural methods at the University of Kentucky yielded a disappointing energy efficiency of 40 to
        1 (input to output). Fortunately, the GROW BIOINTENSIVE method offers farmers significant opportunities for
        production and other energy efficiencies. Chart 2 offers a comparison of the energy required by conventional and

        organic commercial farming, GB home gardening, and conventional and organic home gardening.

        We can see from Chart 2 that Biointensive agriculture – when using the complete GROW BIOINTENSIVE system
        – offers a tremendous potential for reducing overall energy use as compared with mechanized chemical and
        organic farming systems. The system of “essential elements” that make up GB provides several ways to improve the

           3) Efficient Energy Use. Farmers using the method have the ability to grow a balanced vegan               4 diet in 50% less

              space than other methods, and reduce the energy required to produce the food by 50% as compared to a
              standard American diet (U. of Michigan, 2006).


           4) Potential Health Benefits. In an anxious, obese and health-challenged society, one could certainly make
              additional arguments for a nutritionally balanced diet, and the exercise opportunities and potential mental

              and physical health benefits of human-powered agriculture.


         Chart 3 shows energy use in the current commercial food production and processing system, and how integration of
         energy efficiencies such as home production, diet selection, refrigeration improvements, reduction or elimination

         of food waste, and use of GB production methods could allow us to reduce our food system energy requirements
         to as low as 25% of current levels.


         The next chapters will provide an approach for energy-efficient GB production, a method for assessing energy

         use across tasks and methods, and a case study evaluating energy use in GB food production, which shows that
         additional significant energy savings can be achieved by using GB practices.

                       Chart 4: Activity levels and corresponding calorie consumption per individual per task per hour

         These work/Calorie consumption values provide a strong argument for the energy efficiency of a family farm
         model in which activities are distributed according to each person’s strength and energy level. “Dad” (the heavy-

         weight of the group) expends large amounts of energy, but is able to accomplish a lot of work over a short period
         of time by doing heavy tasks that the other, lighter members of the group would find difficult to accomplish. On

         the other hand, the “children” cannot complete heavier tasks efficiently, but can contribute significantly to the
         efficient production of food over time by completing low-calorie tasks with a greater caloric efficiency than the
         adults. For example, to accomplish a task such as watering, a 70-lb female child would use 42 Cal/hr, whereas a

         190-lb male would use 129 Cal/hr, or three times as many calories to complete the same job in the same amount
         of time (see Chart 2).


         A sample energy flow chart for compost production can be seen in Chart 5. This chart provides an “energy
         map” for the process of growing compost crops and creating compost from them, including energy use across

         tasks, energy flow through the system, and ascribed activity values (from one to four, corresponding to the labor
         energy levels listed in Chart 4 for each task).

         By using the Embodied Energy Chart (Appendix 2), developing a farm Energy Flow Chart (Chart 5), and using
         that information combined with the Labor Energy Calculator (Chart 4), energy use and energy efficiency can be

         determined for a single crop or for an entire garden or farm. The Summary Energy Worksheet (Appendix 4)
         allows you to combine data from these charts, making it easier to analyze the use of labor, embodied energy, and
         direct energy.


         Now that you understand how the different parts of the Moore Assessment method function together, it is time
         to demonstrate how it works in the field, and to see how Biointensive agriculture fares in terms of energy use.
         The following chapter contains a case study in which the method is applied to assess energy use in Biointensive

         onion production.


              Case Study: Energy Use in Biointensive Onion Production
                                          in Southeast Pennsylvania                         6

                            Inset: Onions ready to harvest on 6-inch offset spacing (quarter for size comparison)

         Using the Moore Assessment described above, an energy evaluation was performed for a large market garden
         in which 20,000 onions were grown for retail sale using Biointensive techniques. Eight varieties of onions were

         grown: some for extended storage, some for immediate sale, and a few trial varieties. The onions were planted and
         grown in a pattern of 6-inch offset spacing in beds 5 feet wide and approximately 100 feet long (Image 1). This
         gave a population of 621 plants per 100-sq.-ft. growing bed. The information from the evaluation was entered into

         a summary energy worksheet (Chart 6) and calculations were made to determine energy use and overall energy
         production efficiency.

         6 Moore, S.R., 2010, Energy efficiency in small-scale biointensive organic onion production in Pennsylvania, USA, Renewable Agriculture and Food
          Systems, 25:3, p. 181-188
         7 Offset spacing is a method of intensive planting that places alternate rows halfway between the original row spacing. This allows
          the plants to grow closer together, and is one of the “essential elements” of GB that allows for greater productivity in a smaller area.

         The energy efficiency seen in the Biointensive onion example can also be seen in other GB crops. A similar en-
                                                                                                              8
         ergy evaluation was performed on an open-pollinated blue flour corn variety, “Moore Blue.” Under GB grow-
         ing conditions, the three-year average for this crop produced an EER of 63 to 1. This is 16 times greater than
         the reported value of 3.85 to 1 for conventional/mechanically-grown flour corn in southeastern Pennsylvania

         (Pimentel, 1980).

         The average EER using Biointensive production techniques for these two crops was 28 times greater than con-
         ventional fossil fuel-based production of the same crops (see Charts 6 and 7). To add even more to this balance

         in favor of GB production, flour corn also contains a significant amount of carbon in its residues, which under
         the GB system are composted and returned to the garden to help increase soil organic matter and return signifi-
         cant nutrients back to the soil. This carbon sequestration helps offset GHG production.


         These case studies are intended to illustrate the principle and practice of the Moore Assessment energy evalua-
         tion method and tools (worksheets, etc.), so that you can perform similar evaluations for your own production

         processes. They also effectively demonstrate that, unlike conventional fossil-fuel powered agriculture, the GB
         system makes it possible to produce much more crop-energy (40-47 times more, not including energy from the
         sun) than is used to create those crops.


         A sustainable food system for the future will need to produce more energy than it consumes, and do so using re-
         newable energy resources. These case studies indicate that the GB method has a significant potential to increase
         efficiency in both areas, and warrants further investigation.

         and other foods can be fermented, including carrots, beets, garlic, onions, peaches and much more; common fer-

         mented foods include sauerkraut, kimchee, kefir and yogurt.

         Fermentation makes food energy available at a fraction of the processing energy cost required by other techniques,
         and it also increases the nutrition and digestibility of the foods. In contrast to many food preservation techniques

         which can seem daunting if attempted at home, fermentation is relatively simple, and requires only a few basic tools
         and supplies: a knife, a jar/container, and a “starter” created from whey, yogurt, or another previously fermented
         culture. The combination of simple techniques, minimal processing equipment and the absence of refrigeration

         make fermentation a very attractive option from an energy-use perspective, and the health benefits attributed to
         the probiotics in fermented foods are an added bonus.

         Appendix 5 provides additional information on energy calculations and nutritional facts on fermentation, as well

         as a sauerkraut recipe.

         Bed is a 100 sq. ft. unit of area measurement. In Biointensive production, it is a permanent growing area that is
         typically 3 to 5 ft. wide and 20 to 33.3 ft. long.


         British Thermal Unit (BTU) is the standard measure of heat energy. It takes one BTU to raise the temperature of
         one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit at sea level. For example, it takes about 2,000 BTU to make a pot of
         coffee. One BTU is equivalent to 252 calories or .252 Calories.

         Calorie or kcal (1000 calories) is the amount of heat to raise 1000 grams of water 1 degree Celsius.


         Direct Energy is the energy added to a system to perform work.

         Embodied Energy includes both initial and recurringembodied energy (see below). It is the total “life cycle en-
         ergy” used in the collection, manufacture, transportation, assembly, recycling and disposal of a given material or

         product.

         Energy Efficiency Ratio (EER) is the ratio of energy obtained from a crop in relation to the energy used to pro-
         duce it.


         Food Processing Efficiency (FPE) is the ratio of energy used to process food in relation to the energy value of the
         food.

         Initial Embodied Energy is the amount of energy used in the initial manufacture of an object including collec-
         tion, manufacture, transportation, assembly, recycling and disposal of a given material or product.


         Joule (J) is the amount of energy required to raise a 1-kg object 10 cm against the force of gravity.

         Primary Energy is the energy used to produce energy or be converted to another energy source (e.g., the heat
         generated from burning coal, which is then used to create electricity, is primary energy). Sometimes referred to as

         ERE (energy requirement for energy).

         Recurring Embodied Energy represents the energy consumed in order to maintain, repair or replace materials,
         components or systems during the life of an object.


         Secondary Energy is the energy generated or converted from another form of energy (e.g., electricity generated/
         converted from coal is secondary energy).

                                            Recipe for Fermented Sauerkraut
                                                                                   1
                                            by Carol Moore, ND/RN, adapted


             Ingredients to make one quart (950 ml):
             1 medium head of cabbage, any kind
             2 carrots
             1 T (15 ml) caraway seeds
             1 apple
                                                                                 TM                  TM
             1 T (15 ml) salt (any salt will work, but I prefer to use either Real Sor Celtic Sea Salt )
             4 T (60 ml) whey*

             Thinly slice all cabbage, carrots and apples, reserving one large cabbage leaf and the cabbage core. Add
             caraway seeds, salt and whey. Mix well. Pack tightly into wide mouth quart jar. Press or pound firmly with a

             wooden rod (~1 in. (25 mm) diameter works well) until juice covers the vegetables.

             Place the large reserved cabbage leaf on top of the pounded vegetables, pressing down to make sure that
             the leaf is covered by the pressed out vegetable juice. Place the reserved cabbage core on top of the cabbage

             leaf. This is important: the cabbage core keeps the cabbage leaf "cover" over the vegetables submerged in the
             vegetable juice, ensuring an anaerobic environment appropriate for the lacto-fermentation process. Exposure
             to air will cause the fermentation to fail due to oxidation. To avoid this, the vegetables must be kept below the
             liquid level. Leave a one-half to one inch headspace in jar. Cover jar tightly using thumb and ring finger to
             allow the proper air pressure within the jar (not too much, not too little).


             Leave the jar at room temperature for three days. It is best to keep the jar in a pan while fermenting, as
             vegetable juice may bubble up and weep or drip over the sides of the jar. After 3 days (somewhat temperature
             dependent), the lid should bulge and pressure should be felt when trying to push down on the jar lid.

             Refrigerate. Sauerkraut is now ready to eat, but will continue to ferment for several months in cool storage.
             The flavor mellows with time.

             *Whey is an end product of cheese and may be purchased from raw milk organic cheese makers. The clear
             liquid that sometimes sits on top of yogurt is also whey, and may be used as well.


                                       The Energy Cost of Fermented Sauerkraut

             Following the recipe above, cabbage was rinsed, shredded (manually), mixed, pressed into a 1 quart re-used

             canning jar, and a reusable lid was placed tightly on top. Two people working together provided the process-
             ing energy. This was considered “very light work” (see Appendix 3). The energy expenditure for both people
             processing the cabbage was 220 Cal/hr (0.92 MJ/hr). The calculations for this process and the individual
             contributions are as follows.

                       Appendix 6: Energy Equivalent of Human Waste



              About 30% of all energy used in U.S. agriculture goes into commercial fertilizer and pesticide production       1.
              Most of this energy is derived from fossil fuels—for example, 95% of commercial nitrogen is derived from

              natural gas. If we are to build a more sustainable food production system, reducing fossil fuel use and closing
              nutrient cycles (creating a closed-loop fertility system) will be essential.

              One way of achieving closed-loop fertility is to use human waste as a fertilizer. While some may consider

              this an unconventional suggestion, it makes good sense in terms of energy efficiency, and it can be done
              hygienically. One person can provide all the nitrogen necessary to maintain fertility for approximately 6,000
              sq. ft., and the necessary potassium and phosphorus for approximately 1,000 sq. ft. of garden area. In terms

              of energy, human waste as a nutrient source can save significant amounts of fossil-fuel-derived energy. Table
              1 shows the quantity of N, P and K available in human waste per person per year (Beeby, 1998).

             Table 3: Calories per year per person that can be saved by replacing commercial synthetic fertilizers with human waste


              Total energy value for human waste recycling per person per year (before accounting for energy used in col-
              lection and composting of human waste) is 111,030 Calories. Multiply that by the approximately 300 million
              people living in the U.S. and you get 33,309,000,000,000 Calories worth of fossil-fuel energy that we literally
              flush down the toilet each year. Imagine what we could do with all that energy.

                                  PRINCIPLE 2: COMPOSTING 

                                    Goal: Maximize compost quality and quantity
                                                        AND

                                            maximize microbial diversity

        C   omposting is the second leg of the three-legged stool. GB composting strives to produce the maximum
        amount of compost from the materials used. It also maximizes microbial biodiversity through a correctly

        built and “cured” compost pile using plant material from your farm, food scraps from your kitchen, and soil
        from the beds.

        Healthy compost is broken down plant material that returns nutrients and carbon to the soil, so the soil
        regains fertility and waste is minimized. Quality compost in the soil provides sustained release of nutrients
        for plant roots and microorganisms. It provides more aeration for roots and microbes. Compost helps buffer

        challenging soil conditions, like high or low pH, or too much clay or sand. The organic matter in compost
        also helps increase water retention, so you need to water less. By using
        compost to support soil fertility you can be more self-sufficient and            HINT:
        rely less on purchased organic fertilizer.                            Make the base of the pile at least

        To make GB compost, start by picking any space available to put      3 ft x 3 ft (1 m x 1 m) so the pile
        your compost pile, maybe even on a growing bed. Next, gather your     is big enough to retain moisture
                                                                             and heat for healthy decomposition.
        materials, collect them over time and/or use what you have on hand:

        1. Mature Material — Did this plant grow to its old age and produce seed?
           If so, the plant is mature and made up of material that is complex and tougher to breakdown. Think of a corn stalk
           after it has borne fruit. It is structurally strong.

                                                          2. Immature Material — Did this plant grow to its old age
                                                          and produce seed? If not, the plant is immature and made
                                                          of material that is less complex and easier to break down.
                                                          Think of alfalfa plants or lettuce leaves that are very flexible.
                                                          It can sometimes be hard to differentiate between mature

                                                          and immature materials, so just do your best.

                                                          3. Soil — this comes from the first trench of soil you re-
                                                          moved during the double dig. Keep a little around after
                                                          double-digging for compost building.

                                                          4. Roughage -— This is plant material that is thick and
                                                          tough and will take many compost piles before it decom-
                                                          poses. Think of branches from trees or stalks of cassava.
                                                          Roughage is used once in each pile, so only a small amount
                                                          is necessary.

                        Now you are ready to build:
                                                                             6
      Step 1 Gently loosen the soil where you will build down to 12 in (30

              cm), so the pile can drain.

      Step 2 Apply roughage about 4 in (10 cm) thick so the pile can drain
              and breathe.

                                                                             5
      Step 3 Apply a layer of mature material, about 2 in (5 cm) thick and
              water until evenly moist.

      Step 4 Apply a layer of immature material, about 2 in (5 cm) thick
              and water until evenly moist.


      Step 5 Apply a layer of soil about ¼ in (½-1 cm) thick and wa-
              ter. The soil plays an important role, helping to stabilize the
              moisture and temperature levels of the pile and inoculating it
              with microorganisms.
                                                                             4

      Step 6 Repeat steps 3 through 5 until you have used up your mate-
              rials or the pile is tall enough for you to stop working on it,
              whichever comes first.

      Notice that you are using equal volumes of mature and immature ma-
      terials. This is an important component in producing healthy com-

      post, as both the structural integrity of the mature material and the
      less-structural immature material contribute to the process of decom-  3
      position and the humus-formation that make compost so valuable.

                            GB Farmer’s Challenge:

         Get to know your compost pile. Watch it, smell it, and feel it as it
           changes. Even on the inside! Learn to know when it is healthy.
                 Let it teach you how to make even better compost.           2

      If your pile was short when materials ran out or it shrinks a lot, you
      may want to keep adding to the pile when you have more material,

      until you decide to call your compost pile finished. Finishing a pile
      within one month is a good guideline. When you are done building,
      an additional layer of soil on the top will help the pile to hold mois-1
      ture. Your compost pile will begin to shrink after you build it.

                                              To maintain your compost pile:


        Because compost is the result of decomposition, maintaining a compost pile is
        about creating the ideal conditions for this process. Decomposition is carried                 HINT:
        out by microorganisms in the presence of moisture and air; therefore, the pile           Use many different
        must have enough moisture (like a wrung-out cloth) and enough air (too much            kinds of plant material
        moisture limits air). You have four strategies to create the moisture balance you       to support a variety of
                                                                                                microorganisms. This
        want: a) You can loosen your pile, b) water your pile, c)cover your pile or d) do       maximizes microbial
        nothing. In some climates, it may be necessary to water the entire pile, or at
        least the edges daily, to retain moisture. Pile location can help with this too, as    diversity, creating more
        shaded piles will retain moisture better. If you notice a sour smell or white color,      vibrant, healthier
        your compost pile may be anaerobic (not enough air, too much water); loosen              decomposition and
        it to add air. If the materials are not breaking down, your pile may be too dry;       compost—plus natural
                                                                                                  antibiotics in the
        water it and/or cover it to hold the moisture. If all is going well, enjoy observing
        this miraculous process!                                                                soil to encourage the
                                                                                                maintenance of plant
        One to two weeks after finishing your pile (adding material for the last time),                health.
        you may choose to turn the pile. The best time to do this is after the teffimpera-

        ture of the pile has peaked and dropped 20° F (11° C) (you can monitor the
        temperature of the pile using a thermometer). Turning will result in more uniform decomposition, but is not
        absolutely necessary. To turn a pile, choose a site close-by and complete steps 1 and 2 as outlined on the pre-
        vious page. Move your pile with a pitchfork or locally available tool, by taking forkfuls off the top of the pile
        and putting them on top of the new roughage. Form the new pile by placing the less decomposed material
        towards the center of the new pile and the more decomposed material to the outer edges. Water after every

        layer you make, if needed, to establish good moisture (like a wrung out cloth). Turning will add air, restart-
        ing the decomposition process. Now maintain a healthy
        moisture level and let your pile cure.

        The pile should smell musty, then earthy. The materi-
        als should become harder to recognize, ending up as a
        crumbly, brown-black, woodsy-smelling fertile material
        that feels rich to the touch. Your pile should take about
        3-6 months to cure, depending on the climate. When

        you decide it is ready, put it onto already prepared beds,
        working it gently into the top 2-4 in (5-10 cm) of soil.
        The beds are now ready to plant. If you are not ready to
        use the compost, disassemble and dry the pile in a dry,
        airy and warm location, so it doesn’t continue decom-

        posing (over-decomposition reduces the nutrient value
        of the compost). Store compost dry; it will rehydrate
        when you use it.

                                              Notes to Refine Composting:


      ¦ If the material available has a lot of oils or readily available nutrients like coffee grounds, citrus peels, or
         manure, limit it to no more than 1/6th the volume of the completed pile.

      ¦ There ar  e some things that are better to avoid putting into compost piles because they don’t decompose
         well. They have strong components that inhibit the decomposition process, or they contain undesirable
         eggs or seeds that can survive the curing process. Examples include: magnolia and eucalyptus leaves, poi-
         sonous plants, ivy, insect or disease infested plants, etc.

      ¦ The more matur     e material in a compost pile, the cooler and slower the decomposition. The resulting
         compost has higher amounts of stable organic matter that will have positive long-term affects in the soil.
         “Cool” composting is also better at maximizing
         the quantity of cured compost created per unit

         of built compost, which is part of the compost-
         ing goal.

      ¦  A yearly compost application for each gr    owing
         bed is a general guideline.

      ¦ When applying compost, more is not always
         better. Remember to apply a quantity that can
         be sustainably produced by your farm.

      ¦  Because compost is a stable form of organic mat   -
         ter with long-term benefits for soil fertility and
         structure, it is preferable to put all crop mate-
         rial into a compost pile rather than turning crop
         matter directly into the soil.

      ¦  Compost supports soil fer   tility, but it may not
         contribute specific nutrients that a soil is lack-

         ing. For this reason, it is recommended to test
         your soil annually for basic and trace nutrients.
         If the soil is deficient, an annual addition of or-
         ganic amendments as recommended by the soil
         test can help stabilize the soil nutrients.
                                                                A compost sifter helps remove un-decomposed roughage.
      ¦ Caring for soil through composting and careful preparation will help hold onto these nutrients and over

         time you will find yourself needing to add fewer and fewer amendments.

      Agriculture and Climate Change:

      Problems and Solutions


      S  o, we can feel overwhelmed. But then we ask: what can we
      do? Some people – increasingly few these days – respond by
      saying that this type of warming is just a natural cycle, that our
      activities like burning fossil fuels, deforestation and livestock
      production have nothing to do with it, and that there is not

      much we can do about it anyway.
      But as farmers and gardeners, we know there is something we

      can do – but it is not simply to continue farming as most of us
      do,becauseitturnsoutthatourcurrentmethodsoffarmingare
      actuallyalargepartoftheproblem.

      § 25% of carbon dioxide emissions are from cutting and
         burning forests to grow more crops or cattle, burning
         biomass and burning fossil fuels .

      § Livestock production uses 70% of all agricultural land and,
         along with wetland rice cultivation, accounts for about
         50% of all methane production . 3

      § Finally, over 70% of nitrous oxide emissions (one of the
         most heat-trapping of the greenhouse gases) are from the
         use of conventional tillage and conventional fertilizers.

      We as farmers and gardeners know that plants take in carbon
      dioxide from the air and use the carbon to form their stems,
      leaves, roots and flowers. When the plant is harvested, we
      can put that carbon into the soil. So, if we farm in a way that

      maximizes the amount of carbon captured in our crops, and                                                                                             Image: Everystockphoto.com. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/
      we return as much of that carbon as possible to the soil, we
      can effectively remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere
      and store it in the soil.

      Biointensive Compost and
      Carbon Sequestration


      T   his means more food is produced, to offset losses from
      increased temperature and other weather-related causes.
      It also means that our currently used farmland can be much
      more productive and we do not need to cut down forests in
      order to produce more food.

      Also, GROW BIOINTENSIVE® encourages each farm to grow
      its own compost crops, in order to generate its own compost
      material to maintain the organic matter levels and fertility of
      its soil.

      Since compost crops are often taller, larger plants that capture
      more carbon dioxide, growing them increases the amount of
      carbon captured from the air and stored in the soil. In addition,
      with up to four times more carbon-rich crops per unit of
      area, much more carbon is removed from the atmosphere

      with GROW BIOINTENSIVE® compared to current agricultural
      practices.
      While GROW BIOINTENSIVE® can be used for sustainable
      livestock production, its focus is on creating nutritionally

      complete diets primarily from grain, legume, vegetable and
      root crops in order to minimize the total area needed to feed
      ourselves. So, instead of feeding the straw to livestock, and
      generating more methane, it can be returned to the soil. Most
      of the carbon that is returned to the soil as compost or as crop
      residues does not stay in the soil for more than a few years, but
      a small amount will stay for decades or longer.This means that
      growing compost crops and adding compost to the soil is not
      a one-time solution if we want to reduce carbon dioxide levels

      year after year. Instead, we as farmers and gardeners need to    “Agricultural carbon sequestration has the potential to
      grow compost crops and return as much carbon to the soil      substantially mitigate global warming impacts ...practical
      as possible every year or more often in warmer climates in
      order to continually keep the carbon in the soil and out of therganic agriculture, if practiced on the planet’s 3.5 billion

      Finally, GROW BIOINTENSIVE® does not require the use of                                    2

      1. Originally developed from Dr. Kenneth E.F. Watt, The Titanic Effect (SinauerAssociates, Stamford, Connecticut, 1974), p. 41.Adjusted to
         a 1998 yield level in conjunction with 1998 seed stock use and chemical ▯fertilizer applications estimated from yields in USDAYearbook
         1998.

      2. Developed from UN/FAO Yearbook statistics.

      3. Developed from United Nations State of the World Environment Reports.

      4. EcologyAction conservative projection for developing nations based on:

            a) P. Buringh, “Availability ofAgricultural Land for Crop and Livestock Production”, 1989, in D. Pim▯entel and C.W. Hall (eds.), Food
            and Natural Resources, pp. 69-83, San Diego;Academic Press, as noted in “Natural Resources and an Optimum Human P▯opulation”,
            David Pimentel, et al, Population and Environment: A Journal of Interdisciplinary Studies, Vol. 15, No. 5, May, 1994.

            b) UN/FAO data, Worldwatch Institute data and other information.

      According to the sources in footnote 4, the complete loss of world agricultural production might occur:

            a) in the year 2044: following the accelerated projection (production loss if soil deterioration occurs at an increasing, rather than
            linear, rate: assumes 30% soil deterioration rate, on the average, in the first 25 years, and doubled that rate, on the average, in

            the following 25 years). This scenario is chosen and emphasized, as soil depletion does not follo▯w a linear rate as described in 4a and
            4b, above, but rather, accelerates as soil becomes more depleted.

            b) in the year 2060: Pimentel/Buringh’s worst case projection (linear loss of production at the rate of 30% every 25 years). Many t▯hink
            this projection has a good chance of occurring.

            c) or in the year 2118: Pimentel/Buringh’s best case projection (linear loss of production at the rate of 15% every 25 years).

      5. Developed from EcologyAction research and publications.

      6. Avegan diet uses far less water (and other resources) than a high-anim▯al-protein diet. Producing 1 kg of animal protein requires about
         100 times more water than producing 1 kg of grain protein. Pimentel D, P▯imentel M. Food, energy and society. Niwot, CO: Colorado
         University Press, 1996.

    - "<p></p><p>Research by academic institutions has shown that soils that have
      organic matter as 2% of their volume in the upper 11 inches can reduce the water
      needed to grow food crops by 75% over poor soils (those having approximately
      0.5% organic matter in the top 11 inches).<u>1,3</u></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>Soil
      that is shaded by appropriately spaced plants can reduce evaporation up to 63%,

      <span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue\">transpire</span><i> </i>water, meaning they
      take in water through their roots and release water through their leaves.  Transpiration
      can be reduced by as much as 75% in soils that have sufficient and well-balanced
      nutrients in the soil water.<u>2,3</u></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>The GROW BIOINTENSIVE

    - "<p></p><h3>How:</h3>\r\n<h3>Air in the soil supports the growth of plant roots
      and microorganism populations that give life to soil and enhance nutrient availability—factors
      that lead to greater plant growth.  Greater plant growth means more carbon is
      pulled from the air by plants and turned into root systems and plant bodies.
      This additional carbon, when plant bodies are composted and the roots left in
      the ground, leads to increased soil organic matter levels.  Soil organic matter
      contains humus, which carries a negative (-) charge and holds onto positively
      (+) charged water molecules and soil nutrients.  Increased soil organic matter
      supports even greater microorganism populations and leads to increased nutrient-
      and water-holding capability which leads to further plant health and increased
      yields with fewer inputs of nutrients and water. &nbsp;<br></h3>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>How

    - "<p></p><h3>How:</h3><br>\r\n<h3>A Controlled Environment: &nbsp;<br></h3>\r\n<p>Up
      to 10 times the amount of cured (stable) soil organic matter (humus) may be
      produced from the same amount of input material compared to standard practices
      by optimizing the carbon-to-nitrogen ratio, temperature, and moisture level
      of the compost pile in order to support the greatest diversity and populations
      of beneficial microbial life and also minimize carbon loss to the atmosphere
      through oxidation.</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<h3>Water-holding:</h3>\r\n<p>Compost
      can hold up to 6 times its weight in water, depending upon the fraction of humus
      that it contains.</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<h3>Humus: soil organic matter with
      a charge:</h3>\r\n<p>Humus is negatively charged and is thus able to hold on
      to water, which is positively charged, and also to positively charged soil nutrients
      of: NH<sub>3</sub><u>+1</u>, K<u>+1</u>, Ca<u>+2</u>, Mg<u>+2</u>, Na<u>+1</u>,
      Zn<u>+2</u>, Cu<u>+1</u>, Mn<u>+2</u>, Fe<u>+2</u>. &nbsp;Plants absorb water
      through their roots in order to take in needed dissolved nutrients present in
      the soil. &nbsp;Plant water requirements can be reduced by as much as 75% in
      soils that contain sufficient, well-balanced nutrient levels and sufficient
      soil organic matter levels to hold these nutrients in the soil. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<h3>Healthy
      plants from healthy soil life:</h3>\r\n<p>Increased beneficial soil microbial
      life is supported by the increased soil organic matter levels that result from&nbsp;proper
      composting. &nbsp;These beneficial soil microbes provide antibiotics for plants
      and increased nutrient&nbsp;availability, which leads to plants with increased
      resistance to disease and insect life.  Beneficial soil life also competes&nbsp;with
      and decreases the populations of disease-causing soil organisms. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<h3>Soil
      Structure Improved:</h3>\r\n<p>Exudates from soil microbes bind sandy soil particles
      together into larger aggregates and help separate compacted clay&nbsp;soils
      into smaller aggregates, creating pore space for air and water that plant roots
      and&nbsp;beneficial soil microbial life need to survive.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><p></p>"

    - "<p></p><h3>How:</h3>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><b>High Moisture:</b></p><p>Even
      when soil is shaded, water always attempts to move from areas of high humidity
      to areas of low humidity.  A fully developed plant canopy keeps water that moves
      from moist soil to drier air trapped beneath the plants' leaves minimizing further
      evaporation, keeping soil moist and allowing roots to feed on dissolved soil
      nutrients, leading to enhanced plant growth.</p>\r\n<p><br></p><p><b>High CO<sub>2</sub>:</b></p>\r\n<p>Soil
      microbial life is constantly consuming soil organic matter (soil carbon) while
      breathing in oxygen present in the entrapped soil air.  Microbes exhale CO<sub>2</sub>,
      which then moves from the soil to the atmosphere.  A fully developed plant canopy
      keeps CO<sub>2</sub> that moves from the soil to the atmosphere trapped beneath
      the plants' leaves where it is able to be taken in by the plants through the
      plant leaves' stomata, leading to further-enhanced plant growth.</p>\r\n<p><br></p><p><b>Moderate
      Temperature:</b></p>\r\n<p>The high concentration of moisture trapped beneath
      the plant canopy moderates the temperature between the soil surface and the
      underside of the plant leaves (making it warmer in the winder, cooler in the
      summer), which leads to a moderated soil temperature, which leads to a moderated
      plant root temperature and increased soil microbe activity, which lead to further-enhanced
      plant growth. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><p></p>"
